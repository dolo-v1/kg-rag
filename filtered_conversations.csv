"I had cervical laminectomy surgery for spinal stenosis in Aug 2010. Since then I have a real tight neck that wants to keep dropping , neck pain , light headedness, back pain, occasional loss of balance and trouble walking and climbing steps. I recently lost my job because of these issues. My Neurologist thinks it is all coming from the neck tightness. My Neuro Surgeon disagrees and sent me to Physical Therapy and a Pain Management Doctor. They both agree with my Neurologist. The Pain Management Specialist told me that there is nothing that can be done. He told me 1 out of 10 or 1 out of every 12 with this surgery end up like me. In the past 3 months I started experiencing tremors in my right hand, right arm, shoulder, neck & head. Aggressive at times. I have tremors pretty much daily now. My Neurologist retired but wanted me to get a second opinion because I am progressing. I have not yet had a second opinion away from the same Medical Practice. I was about to when my Neuro Surgeon called and wanted me to get a Neck MRI. She referred me to another Neurosurgeon she works with to have more surgery. I saw the new Neurosurgeon. He explained he wants to take the hardware from my previous surgery out of the back of my neck and put it in the front to hold my head up. I was told it would not relieve the pain or any other symptoms I am having. I was also sent to another Neurologist in the same practice. She has no idea what is going on. Parkisons was ruled out. Both Neurosurgeons think there is something else going on and it s not coming from my neck. I can feel everything coming from my neck. I have had since May 2 neck MRI s & 4 Botox Injections, in the last 30 days an EEG, Brain MRI & CT Scan. All are normal except CT scan. It was to check healing for removing metal in my neck. I have an appointment to talk about that in a few weeks. Do you think there could actually be 2 different problems? My neck is really tight and like I said before I feel everything but my hand and arm tremors coming from my neck. I am really confused.",Thanks for writing to us. You have complex story with multiple issues and not pointing to a particular one problem. Tremors can happen in severe cervical spine stenosis due to weakness in extremities. Do you have significant weakness in hands? Neck Chat Doctor.  Difficult to tell you the exact answer however if neurologist ruled out other brain related disorder then you may consider doing anterior cervical surgery. Thanks.
"Hello, At the end of lacrosse practice about a week ago i recieved a nasty cross check to my deltoid. The check hit wierd, as it went under my pad. The pain came in right away, couldnt move my arm for the rest of the night. I was surprised to see that that there was a very small bruise , but my whole shoulder hurts to the point where i cannot do simple tasks such as passing the ball. I can slowly move my arm fine, but when i speed things up it stings all over. I have bern icing it every day. I have been on advil only to help with the pain, but is there anything else i can do? Do you know what could be wrong? Any methods of treating it faster? I need to get back on the field asap before try outs are over.","Dear List, I believe you may have suffered a muscle strain, maybe even a partial tear. What the muscle and shoulder desperately needs now is absolute rest in some sort of """"sling""""! But, it seems you really want to """"hit the road"""" again; which is rather unfortunate. May I suggest you give your body time to heal. There can be another try out. You may also wish to consider the advice of an Orthopedic Surgeon or Clinical Physiotherapist. Best regards."

i have PCOD and to induce my periods the doc advised me to take Deviry for 10 days...today was the ninth day and i missed taking my Deviry tablet on the 8th day. I had unprotected sex for like 15 seconds and then we switched back to a condom. There was no ejaculation inside me. I also took the Deviry tablet today. Should I take an emergency contraceptive pill too?,"Hello, Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor for posting your query. I have gone through your question in detail and I can understand what you are going through. Not needed as of now. With a 5-min unprotected sex, It's very unlikely that you become pregnant even without ejaculation. You need not take emergency pills and as the periods are due you can just wait. Hope I am able to answer your concerns. If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you.

I have been on birth control pill for about 3months and last week when I was supposed to take placebo pills but instead I skipped them and started a new sheet. Now my period has been late by about 4days and Im starting to freak out if im pregnant or I just skipped a period. I have no spitting or bleeding whatsoever. Do I have a high chance of being pregnant?,"Hi, I understand your concern.  You are on contraceptive pills for last 3 months. This month also you had taken the pills without any break... only thing is instead of taking the bland pills. your straight way started with active pills of new packs.... The placebo pills are meant for getting breakthrough bleeding (which we call menses). Between two packs. But by taking new pack again you have extended the hormonal effect for one more cycle. That's why you have skipped one menstruation.  Please don't worry, if you continue with the new pack regularly, your contraceptive protection would continue. And you will get bleeding next month while you take placebo pills for 7 days.  - In case you have some doubts, you can stop taking the pills now, wait for 8 days without any pills. You would get bleeding in these days. Now, you have to throw the pack you were taking & start with a new pack on 5th day again.  Thanks."

"i have SEVER muscle pain in lower back the muscle spasms or freezes for a few seconds every step or to. I have had sciatica for the past 32 yrs I have been off work for 13 mths just went back wed 12hr nights in health care, very strenuous job and the pain is unexplainable. I took 2 Tylenol 3 just before going in then about 2 hrs later a robaxin 750mg and nothing. I held in there for 4 hrs I dont know how, got replaced and left. To sit down after the first 3 hrs was so hard to do, it made it easier to walk out to the car. I need something better than this, I have to be able to perform my duties pain free. I have taken medication my whole life due to migraines, have been on every medication, therefore most medications I take are not low dosages, then I become afraid to take them because I dont want to become addicted to anything. I only take pills when l am in severe pain, maybe thats the problem.  I need to know what medication I can try what l can do before my next shift in a few days.   Thank you",Welcome to Chat Doctor The Sciatica is a result of the nerve compression between the vertebra which causes the symptoms. The symptoms do not resolve until the subsidence of the inflammation and release of compression on the nerve fibers. The treatment option available are neurotransmitter block agents like Gabapentin along with painkillers and vitamin B complex. Appropriate lying position like on hard surface and physiotherapy. Consult Neurologist for better opinion. ThanksRegards
"I got my period last week and after my period I engaged in sexual intercourse. We did use a condom but it slipped off, so I took two of the plan B pills. One week later, I started to have vaginal bleeding . This lasted for about 3 days and stopped today. But today I ve been feeling chest and stomach pains. The chest pains seem to be whats called, Heart Burn and I m wondering if this is supposed to happen? Thank you","Welcome to Chat Doctor, Plan B pill are emergency contraceptive pills. It is normal to have vaginal bleeding after taking the pills. Many women also experience some side effect such as stomach pain, but this is subsided in a couple of days. Avoid spicy food and take tab omeprazole 20 mg before breakfast once daily for 7 days. This will reduce the stomach pain. Your menstrual cycle will become regular in 2 to 3 months.

"I went to a Kidney doctor recently, had been going to one for about 5 years, but they seem to keep changing on me. This new Dr. said he wanted to lower my B.P. more, and they day I as in to see him it was a bit high 146/78 but no really that much out of line. He said he would like to see it 140/70 or less. The next day it was 131/68, and hadn t taken the prescription he recommended. However did take it a couple of days later, and my feet and ankles swelled and are still swelled, the Med was Amalodapine the dose I was on was .5 and he doubled it. I called him today, and he put me back on my regular dose, but added a new B.P. med called Spironolactone .25 mg. I have been on Lorsartin and Amalodapine for several years and it has been holding my B/P under control pretty well. Why would he want to be changing it...my thinking is if it s not broken, don t fix it, and my regular health care physician had put me on it. This is a new, young Dr. and it was my understanding that they no longer want your B/P to get to low, to you don t function well?? What is your opinion on this new med. He told me not to take my over the counter Potassium. Thanks, Betty","Hello, Amlodipine may cause pedal edema in some individuals. So he reduced the dose. Spironolactone is a potassium sparing diuretic. It is used to reduce edema of legs. If renal function is not good means better to avoid losartan. Because it will increase serum creatinine levels.

I had cosumed 2 drinks after tinidazole treatment( after 48 hrs)",Welcome to Chat Doctor. Reports suggest that there is some inflammation of liver (Hepatitis). It is difficult to say what has caused Hepatitis. They are commonly causes due to viruses/ some medications/alcohol/gall stones etc. If you have fever/vomiting/abdominal pain - you may need sonography to rule out gallstones/cholecystitis. I feel your doctor after clinical examination must have felt that no further investigations are necessary at this stage and have advised to take this treatment.
"Hello Im about a 32 to 33 day cycle, I was to start my period on 2/13 now 7 days late...Ive had a dull lower back ace for about 2 weeks now and at night feel a little nauseous, around Jan 25 I went to ER for a kidney stone they have me anitbotics and waited for it to pass also told me I had another in my kidney but nothing yet. Ive takenamy pg test and all negative.  Would a Kidney stone or the meds be the reason for my delayed period? Ive also felt very full in my tummy region any help or suggestions would be great","Hi, There is no relationship between renal calculi and hemorrhagic. Having period delayed up to 15 days is considered normal but other condition (physiological /pathological)cannot be denied. The symptom you had like LBP ain, nausea, urinary symptoms generally occurs in renal calculus. Generally calculus up to 5 mm size can come out through urine(as small ureteric did isms)but sometime did of 7 mm have been found to be expelled with a lot of pain.  So is it is less than 5 mm wait for Lithuania otherwise operative (ESL /PCNL)should be done. Regarding delayed period wait for 1 more week if still awaited then meet gone clinic.  Thanks n regards"
Hello My son is 2 years old and have a allergy problem and doctor start Myteka sachet for one month pls tell me its right because last week he have a infection and dr start Cyclor bt after one week again he have infection and dr started injection for treatment pls reply,"Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. From your history, I guess that your son has got frequent respiratory complaints, most probably due to allergy. Myteka contains montelukast, and it does not have major side effects even after using for a few months in child Chat Doctor.  Rarely, a child may have nausea, vomiting, headache, etc., but they are not seen in most of the patients. I would like to inform you that infections are different from allergies. So if your son is having recurrent allergies, please do not worry. There are good controlled medications for allergic respiratory symptoms. However, if he is having recurrent infections, I would suggest you to consult a pediatrician who may suggest some tests for immunodeficiency. It's an entirely different group of diseases, fortunately far less common than allergic disorders. Hope this will help you. Wish your son fast recovery & best health. Regards."
"I have had swollen feet, legs and ankles for about 4 weeks now and it doesn t seem to ever go down. I have been to my doctor and he has given me lasix but it doesn t seem to help. At night my legs and feet ache. Can you tell me what might be going on? Thanks","Hello, As you mentioned the lasix being prescribed to you, are you diabetic or having any cardiac pathology like high blood pressure. Usually swelling in the lower limbs - leg, ankle and feet occur due to lack of venous return. Having an understanding of the cardiac pathology and any venous return issues in the lower limbs should let us help understand the cause for it. Also, doing regular exercise in low intensity helps improve the muscle physiology and also the cardiac output where these symptoms can be avoided. Hope I have answered your query.

If menses happen you are not pregnant,2.if menses doesn't happen after 3-4days/or you're in very much hurry to get rid of tensionfull mind-am i pregnant....u do urinary pregnancy test.this test kit is avail bl at affordable prices in your nearby medical stores...buy it, do it by ourself. If its negative you are not pregnant,,,if positive visit a nearby gynecologist for further help3.if still u in dilemma of pregnancy then a scan(ultrasound of abdomen n pelvis)can be done, in scan its possible to see an embryo/baby is there or not...but NOT NECESSARY DEAR...RELAX....4.when a husband/wife are meeting after a long time of gap then it's better to use condoms...whiz d logic behind I will explain.let's say u people meet up once in 15 days, so max 2 times in a month u do sex/coitus.to avoid pregnancy for this two times in month meeting you are on medicines for almost 28 days...of course result of medicine-u won't b pregnant but u will b exposed more no of days for side effects of medicines....I hope u understood...so usually Jen husband/wife meet up occasionally as they live at long distances...we advise condoms.

Every possibility is assessed with respect to risk factors that may be present for that condition. Although You have not mentioned details such as your age, the nature of cough, type of cough, any factors/time of day you have more cough, any other medication(for some other condition) you are taking etc. Yet few of the reasons a patient may be having long-lasting cough can be Bronchial asthma-In this the patient has Chat Doctor.  Chronic bronchitis can be another cause for chronic cough, although it is more common in smokers of middle age & elderly, still non-smokers may also develop it due to various other risk factors.

"Q. My 40 years old wife is suffering from recurrent fever for the last 3-4 months. It started with high fever with chills, so he was given anti-malarial drugs and he felt normal. Then again after 15 days he got the fever with chills then he was given antibiotics. Again after 15 days of the treatment, the same thing happened and he was given anti-malarial Flacigo.","If fever is persistent since 3-4 weeks it might be due to typhoid or some other infection so first I will advise you to go for blood test to rule out the cause. For treatment, you can take some antibiotic preferably moxikind-cv or IFIC after expert advice along with kilos or nimeson-p for high grade fever. You can take some multivitamin like metilda-forte or meganeuron-plus once daily preferably in afternoon. Do cold sponging to reduce the temperature of your body.

THANK YOU DOCTOR","Hi, Asthma is itself an allergic disease due to cold (or dust or pollen or grass etc.) irrespective of the triggering factor. Your asthma actually triggers bronchospasm which leads to your wheezing and breathing difficulty. You can go for pulmonary function tests if not done. Treatment is mainly symptomatic which might require inhalation steroids, beta agonists, anticholinergics as MDI or rota haler as a regular treatment. There are very good medicines like steroids, alpha a Chat Doctor. To decrease the inflammation of bronchi and bronchioles, you might be given oral antihistamines with mast cell stabilizers(montelukast) and steroids (prednisolone) with nebulization and frequently steam inhalation. The best way to cure any allergy is a complete avoidance of allergen or triggering factor. Consult your pulmonologist for further advise."

my grandfather is 80 years old and he was diagnosed of having a chronic renal failure stage 5.. Is it possible for him to survive if he undergo a kidney transplant? I am willing to donate my kidney for him.. another option is dialysis but i think that would be painful to him. He told me that the dextrose inserted to him NaCl was painful so I thought how much more if he will undergo dialysis 2x a week that ll be very painful. I want kidney transplant for him. pls help me.. thanks,"Dear Sarah, thanks for query. Your sentiments are fine and understandable, but you also need to know whether he will sustain this kind of major surgery. He is quite aged and major surgery at his age carries more risk, apart from he must be having other medical conditions like hypertension and diabetes which has lead to this kidney failure. Dialysis is of course a not a cure for this, but this will help him to stay alive. Please discuss this with your doctor also. Bye and take care."
"Hi,I am suffering from hair loss and thinning of hair. I am looking for a good dermatologist in Bangalore, who can help me to reduce the hair loss process and regrow my hair. I have a family history of hair loss, but I believe I can slow it down with medicines. I have been using Minoxidil 10% from past one year, I think its effectiveness has reduced with the passage of time. I would be grateful, if you can help me out. Am quite tensed, thanks","Hello, I can understand your concern it would be very helpful if I could know your age and gender and see some pictures of your scalp. You may have halogen effluvium of female pattern hair lessor an Chat Doctor. Hairfall may be due to lack of nutrients like iron or proteins in body, it may also be due to deranged thyroid levels. So to rule out halogen effluvium I would advise you to get your he, serum ferritin and thyroid levels tested.it may be genetic too. Application of minoxidil and oral biotin once a day can really be helpful to you. Minoxidil is slow method, it takes time to show results, and you have to be compliant with its use, leaving it abruptly can again result in hair loss. So be patient and keep using it. Still if you don't find any results you can go for procedure like PRP (plasma rich platelet) therapy, it could help you as results seen are very good. And you can consider hair transplant too.

"Hello. Im a 25 year old female weigh 145 pounds solid. I have been trying to conceive since October 2012. I was on Mirena for about 3 years until October it fell out while I was bathing. I called my GYN an he said that it was ok longs I was not having any discomfort. Which I wasnt. During intercourse, I tend to bleed. That has happened 3 months ago. No bleeding since, but I now i experience pain during intercourse. I have lost all my sex drive. Feels like my hormone level is way low amongst other things. My menstrual cycle is way off. It does not come on the same time each month and at times I go a month without it. Its been like day January 22, February day 31, March day 31, no cycle in April ,and a cycle on May 18.

Please help!!!","Hi, You should see a specialist for a local exam and a pap smear. The cause of the bleeding and the pain should be localized. Also, you would need a complete hormonal profile to see if any hormonal disturbances are causing the abnormal menstrual cycles. Sudden weight disturbances, stress, infections or certain medications also can cause menstrual irregularities. Please get a complete assessment and maintain a healthy weight.

I have been diagnosed with aspergillosis from culture a year ago but recent culture shows nothing after 4 weeks. Cat scan in Denver shows ground glass looking things in lower left lung.

I m also infusing IGG to keep my immune system up.,"Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, The diagnosis of Aspergilli depends on the clinical symptoms of the patient like fever, cough, chest pain, skin test for A fumigates, level of IGE and Egg, chest X-ray and CT-scan findings. Culture of saliva or pulmonary aspirates for Aspergillus pneumonia also help to confirm the diagnosis.In regard to the treatment, systemic antifungal therapy is prescribed depending on the severity of the symptoms.

I am getting better slowly. I was wondering why I need to take this drug, periodically when I get sick like this. Thank you.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, As you are a known case of asthma for which your doctor has prescribed prednisolone 50 mg for 7 days, you are also known to have infection of sinus. Your doctor has prescribed the oral steroids for your symptoms of asthma, because it will reduce the edema caused by the allergens, and it helps to dilate the bronchioles which helps to relieve the symptoms of bronchospasm. As your doctor has prescribed this medicine you have to take it for 7 days, and you cannot discontinue abruptly. For sinus infection you may require the course of antibiotics, so I would suggest you to lateral Antibiotics like Tab Autoclave, 625 mg, twice daily for 5 days. Oral antihistamines like Least for 5 days. Thank you."

I had a biopsy on my inner thigh 4 weeks ago ... think it may be infected ... could not get into the dermatologist who did the biopsy (confirmed hives) for him to check today. I have some Cipro 500 mg that I use for chronic UTI s ... should I start taking it just in case until I can see the Dr. on Monday?,"Hi, It is inadvisable to start a course of antibiotics before confirming the presence of an infection. You could temporarily use an antibiotic ointment and a cold compress on it. Once you meet your dermatologist, he will see the wound site and may even take a swab if there is some pus before putting you on antibiotics so that the antibiotics can be tailored to the organism that is there.

At present I am taking the drug Afinitor...in the past few days I have developed severe pain in my lower jaw where a root canal was done about 7 years ago.  I went to the dentist and they said the tooth is OK and gave me some antibiotic pills to get rid of the infection...I have only been taking them for about 1.5 days but still have the pain so I have been taking extra strength tylenol (2 every 4 hrs)...sometimes this works and sometimes it doesnt...I am also using a cold compress on the area but am still not getting much relief.  I am now considering taking some Tylenol 3 (with codeine)!  Do you think this poses any problems in interaction with the Afinitor.,"Hello, Thanks for posting your query.

My name is AAAAA I have been diayliseing for nearly 7 years, My e-mail address is  YYYY@YYYY",Hi I am Chat Doctor. As you are on dialysis for the last 7 years your blood chemistry is not normal. Various harmful mobiles that are secreted by the body are regularly washed by kidneys and in your case the dialysis. Bruising can be due to multiple causes most likely due to blood thinners.

Hopefully that will turn out to be normal and you don't have to worry about that if it doesn't happen frequently. Thanks

It is unfortunate that you are suffering from skin disease lichen plans from past 10 years. HomeopatChatDoctoredicine may not be that useful to treat this condition. Even in allopatry, you can only control the disease, but you cannot cure the illness. You can do the following things to keep your disease under check and control:1. Antihistamines that help alleviate itching.2. Topical corticosteroid cream or ointment to reduce swelling and redness.3. Systemic Corticosteroid such as prednisone helps when lichen plans lasts a long time.4. PVA therapy is a light treatment that can help clear the skin.5. Retinoid acid applied to the skin or given as a pill to clear the skin.6. Tacrolimus ointment or pimecrolimus cream is used to treat eczema.

Tender & sore nipples, sickness are suggestive of pregnancy. Specially after having unprotected sex after normal period. If it was around ovulation. . Day.

"Hi, I have PCOD problem.I took Menogaun injection 150 mg from day 3 to 6 and again after follicle study on 13th day again 2 injections. On 16th day i had 18mm follicle in my left ovary.i took ChatDoctor on 17th day and IUI on 18th day. And was told to have intercourse on 19th and 20th day. today is my 19th day.I had intercourse yesterday. Will i have my egg still active should i have intercourse today?","Hallow dear, I have understood your concern. Usually the follicle is mature to release healthy egg at 18 mm size. In. Chat Doctor was given to you when the follicle was 18 mm size. So it was well the timed. The egg is released usually within 24 hours of Chat Doctor injection. Hence, immediately on the next day, very rightly GUI was performed. Now daily intercourse for two days after that is advised for additional coverage, in case the egg is released late. After the ovulation life of an egg is 24 hours. So any intercourse after that may not be of use from fertility angle. Continuation of ultrasonography for confirmation of ovulation might have been useful to decide how long daily or alternate days' intercourse is to be continued. However, there is no harm in continuing daily intercourse even otherwise also. I hope I have clarified your doubts. This information may be useful to you if needed (which I wish should not be required) for future cycles."

"Hi, I am having problems with a upper tooth that I had removed 4 weeks ago. It all started when my tooth was damaged through a basic root canal treatment. I was referred to a specialist and 9 months later I was told it would have to be extracted, meanwhile I had faced a number of infections and 2 courses of antibiotics. At the time of the extraction the root was infected. After the extraction, dissolvable stitches were put in place as I was flying overseas and the sinus was exposed. Now, 4 weeks later, my dossolvable stitches are still in place and seem to be surrounded by a white gooey substance. When I touch with a Q tip the white substance moves about, attached to the stitches and is adding to some slight irritation of that area. Is this normal?

You were advised to follow abstinence for 10 days following treatment for trichomoniasis. This was to ensure complete irradiation of the Richmond from both partners systems. Incomplete recovery in either of parents leads to reinfection. Many a times second course is needed for full recovery.  You're having a short period of abstinence, there remains a possibility of reinfection. You can use a course Vaginal pessaries to avoid it.

M 26 year old..unmarried... having dizziness..shoulder neck pain and imbalance problem for 4 years..now its getting worse... ctscan is done ..everything is normal in that...i cant rotate my eyes and even neck..everything seems floating... dr recommended me..dizitac andclonax ...nothing is improved Plzzz help me out ...plz help me feeling nobody is understanding my problem,"Hithank-you for providing the brief history of you.a thorough clinical neuromuscular assessment is advised. As you mentioned of facing issue with shoulder pain, neck pain, balance issues etc. I will recommend first to take the detailed clinical assessment. Based on this we can understand as what MRI needs to be performed. But on a safer side taking and MRI of the cervical spine and brain in contrast will make some insight. The pain in the neck and shoulder - this looks more of the Neuromuscular issue. Like if there is any pinch of the nerve root in the cervical spine then there is a possibility of the radiating symptoms and pain. For which physical therapy is a choice to get solution for. Evidence of research has a good support. For the balance issue - it should be assessed in detail as this can occur due to two issues. One any vestibular related issue or any cerebellar related issue. Understanding the proper clinical examination and the MRI should help assist further by which the help can be initiated. For anything more you can surely ask me I will be happy to assist you.

From your question it looks that your husband has a psychotic illness, he is on separate sprinkles and risperidone 3 mg but still has auspiciousness and talks out of context. Dosage of separate is not mentioned.  From my clinical experience I can say that either the dosage of the medicine is low or maybe he is not taking it regularly. So, if you are sure of compliance, it will be very helpful to increase TH dose of risperidone to 4 mg - 6 mg in a day. Along with it, I have seen clonazepam 0.5-1 mg effective in case when patient is difficult to manage /gets very angry/unable to sleep, on as and when required basis. It is advisable to get sodium valproate levels done, to ensure that the sprinkles are providing adequate among of Chat Doctor.

The anticipation of these attacks causes further anxiety. If these attacks are very distressing I would advise you to start a SSRI preferably Paroxetine (Part CR 12.5 mg) at bedtime and continue it for at least 6 months. It can be increased further with a psychiatrist advice.  You should not take Mizoram unsupervised for so long. Also get one ECG and TSH done to rule out any other physical cause of anxiety.

"Areas of skin on arms, shoulders, abdomen are intensely itchy before a bump appears. The bump appears to have a tiny hole in the center. The bump is symmetrical and round. When it is healing it appears to have an indention in the skin (like a little skin is missing). It may start to dry up and appear to heal, but then the itching starts again and the whole cycle repeats. Topical steroids are less effective for itch than triple antibiotic oint. I am desperate and have even switched from goats milk soap to pine tar soap. I have allergies/ asthma . I take allergy shots, but these areas are not hives . The only secretions that come from these bumps are blood (or clear fluid). If they ever do manage to heal, my skin is left scarred.","Hello, It does appear that you may have eczema, although they are not intensely itchy. I hope these have not happened after the allergy shots in which case you need to get the concentration and content of the shots (subcutaneous immunotherapy, I suppose) reviewed by your Allergist. Long-acting antihistamines are recommended as a trial in the first instance. If you wish to exclude a fungal infection, a skin scraping needs to be taken and KOH preparation under Woods lamp will reveal this. However, this is unlikely.

Dengue serology.Don't take any painkillers except Paracetamol for fever. This is my personal opinion for you based on available details. If you have any further query please ask me.

Have been trying to fall pregnant for the past 10 months with no success. We have a 2 year old. My Dr prescribed Fertodim-50 and said I should take it on day 2 of my cycle for 5 days. My cycle is 25-28 days. I took it this month and started intercourse on the 9th day according to my Dr and fertility calculator. We had sex for 3 consecutive days. Should we have proceeded after the 3rd day and how exactly should I be taking the pill if I m not pregnant ?,"Hallow Dear, Fatimid pills are the tablets of Camphene citrate. I would have appreciated had you taken some more scientific steps as described below:1. From day 9 onwards, subject yourself for the ovulation monitoring by ultrasonography. Usually the egg is released when the follicle attains the size of 18 mm to 21 mm. So you can plan your sexual relations accordingly. Ultrasonography also will provide an evidence of egg release. 2. Some prefer to give In. Chat Doctor when the follicle is matured to have guaranteed and planned egg release. So from a couple of days before that to few days after injection, sexual contacts are advisable. 3. Camphene citrate should not be taken for more than 6 cycles. If it does not result into pregnancy, you may have to change over to HMG/Chat Doctor combination for induction of ovulation. If all these fail, you may have to go for Artificial Reproduction Technique. I hope this provides you brief and still apt guidelines."
A few days ago I noticed a small red bump on the top of my left foot that itched a little. It grew in size and a few days later I had a few more bumps on my left foot and on my fingers. Also a few on my right calf. The ones that I scratched weep a clear fluid when I rub them with an alcohol wipe. Those I don t scratch are a hard looking people that only itch if I rub them. I recently started using Cortizone Cream.Is this poison ivy or what?,"Hello, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor.

"Sir, Iam using encorate chrona for my daughter since 5months as prescribed by nuerologist she is putting on weight is ti the side effect of the medicine this has been prescribed for 2 years for absent seizures she is 8 yrs old now?------ YYYY@YYYY","Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted your daughters symptoms. She has absence seizures, which seem to be well controlled with sodium valproate. However, she is also putting on weight. Most probably, weight gain in your daughter is related to the use of sodium valproate. We should not stop valproate, as her seizures may worsen. Instead, we can control her diet and make her play outdoor games. These measures would keep her weight in check. I hope my answer helps.

"Hi, I recently had an attack that lasted about 2 hours.  It was uncontrollable shaking stemming from pelvic area.  Down the legs, cold chills with extreme abdominal & pelvic pains.  And also my penis felt painful as well. No joking here.  This type of attack happened one other time, but I was pretty sure that was triggered by a prescription nasal spray with some steroid","Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor. Forum.  You had uncontrolled shaking from pelvic area, down the legs, cold chills with extreme abdominal and pelvic pains.

hi. I went to see a doctor about 4 days ago because I was on amoxicillin treatment due to tonsil infections and after I forgot to finish my dosage I went in for another one because the symptoms and signs were starting to show again. the doctor gave me an injection on my buttocks and now I feel numb around the hips and when I try to press the area I was injected I feel like some stringy thing around the numb area. what can be the cause of this numbness?,Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. As per your complaint it seems that you have got a nerve injury with the pricking needle that is used in the injection and due to nerve injury there is numbness in the injection site along with the adjoining area supplied by the nerve leading to numbness. The stringy substance that you are feeling can be due to infection leading to pus formation. Mostly nerve injuries caused by needle prick are transient and the sensation almost completely recovers. As of now you can take vitamin B complex daily as it helps in nerve regeneration and healing. Do warm compresses over the numb area. If there is any stringy discharge you should consult a Physician and get evaluated so that he can give you oral and topical antibiotics for resolution of infection. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.
"i want to donate my kidney to my friend who last night was sent to the hospital for kidney failure they said he needs a transplant as soon as possible, i have the same blood type but it hasnt been a month since i have smoked. i smoked three nights ago. im 19 years old 5 foot 7 and im healthy. so is it ok to be  a smoking kidney donor","Hi & Welcome to Chat Doctor. I appreciate your generosity and gesture towards your friend. You will not be considered as an eligible donor unless you stop smoking for at least 8 weeks prior to donating the kidney. This is because there are many known health risks from smoking1. It can cause potentially life-threatening respiratory complications during or immediately after anesthesia. 2. It may also increase the risk of developing blood clots in the leg veins which can break loose, travel to the lungs and potentially cause death.  3. Furthermore, it causes increased mucus production and a decreased ability to clear the lungs which can lead to pneumonia. 4. Furthermore, it causes decreased wound healing.  To be eligible you must quit smoking first and after 8 weeks you can donate the kidney to your friend after getting the pre-operative medical fitness. Since smoking is associate with a number of diseases of the heart and the lungs and various cancers so, it's better to quit smoking ASAP. Hope I could answer your query."
j have a left leg retaining fluid with a very painful heel..burning and sharp pains. what can be the cause and what can I do? I had non hodgkins lymphoma three years ago and I am still having booster treatments evert three months. the swelling first started after I had a biopsy on on the lympb node in the liower back can dr Mathew Mintz reply,"Dear, There must be the recurrence of the disease or must be residual disease after the initial treatment for non Hodgkin lymphoma. The swelling of the leg is because of the pressure on the lymphatic vessels by the tumor. If the chemotherapy has not relieved it, did your doctors advise local radiotherapy in the inguinal area. You can discuss it with your doctor, and he will be the right person to tell you whether you could be benefited with it. Residual disease after chemotherapy is most of the time taken care with Radiotherapy. Truly,"

Pills are hormone based and can alter the concentrations of your natural hormones there by leading to menstrual irregularities. Since you changed abruptly your initial birth control and introduced a new one, it is possible that it is the change that lead to this. Menstrual irregularities e.g., spotting, breakthrough bleeding or amenorrhea can occur during its use. Most of these side effects are mild and usually disappear after a few months of contraceptive use. So I suggest you worry less than stress on its own can lead to menstrual irregularity. Hope this helps"

"Hi Docs,My daughter 36 weeks birth, ~ 2.2 Kgs now and one month now is having grade 1 acid reflux. Every couple of hours she generally clenches her fists and her eyes are stuck on one side with the legs straightened. She is on Lanzol (once a day) and Domstal (1Ml three times a day). She is having gas all the time, any thing I can do lessen her pain... Thanks in advance.","Preterm babies often have laxity of muscles including that of the lower end of the food pipe which may cause the stomach acids to reflux. The acid is otherwise essential for the digestion of the food. The solution is not in giving Landon although Coastal may be given. The main solution is proper burping of the baby. Hold the child erect on your lap for around 20 mins after each feed. It should take care of the problem. If you put down the baby on the bed soon after the feed, reflux is not unusual."
"Hi my name is Ernie, im 27 year old male. Been dealing with alot of issues for six months consisting of heart palps , irregular rythem, dizzy/lightheadness not vertigo, change in bowels. My doc says its all anxeity related. Recently I found out I have vericocele no pain though. My blood work shows total Testosterone at 392 and B12 at 315. My doc put me on 2000mcg of B12 for a month but after 2 weeks i noticed i get pain in left arm and tingly fingers in left hand so i stopped taking the B12 pill and it went away, does this show B12 causing me a blood clot? Tommorow morning i go get my total t tested again and the free t also b12 tested again to see if there has been improvement. Sorry for the paragraph i appreciate your time.","Ernie, the B12 is probably a red herring. It probably didn't cause the problem you started with or the arm sensations. When you have the constellation of things that are bothering you, it is reasonable to look for a systemic problem. It sounds as though your doctor has done that and not really found a culprit. Often, the problem is not an illness but a lack of some of the things that we all need to stay healthy. Specifically ask yourself and of your doctor about, Exercise: Exercising every day for 20 minutes should be your goal. Is your body weight excessive. A little can go a long way if it is mostly in your belly where it affects sleep, joints, heart rhythm and when you're older, diabetes and heart disease. Abnormal sleep. Sleep disturbance is often present in people who are overweight, particularly those who snore. If you are very tired in the morning, sleep easily during the day and snore loudly, you may have sleep apnea. It is a common cause of abnormal heart rhythm requiring treatment."

I did just start taking Celexa 3 days ago and melotonin at night for sleeping 2 days ago.Thank you,"HIT hank for asking to ChatDoctorSudden abdominal pain is indicative of many possibilities and sometimes nothing's comes out, colicky abdominal pain can be considered, just take a rest, no need to take anything by mouth (Food) wait for half an hour if subsided then it's okay if it does not then try antispasmodic (Dicyclomine) it will come around for sure, further query will be answered ask without hesitations have Nice day."

Infection is indicated due to presence of few pus cells in semen. Normally semen shouldn't contain any pus cells. Few RBC in semen may be due to infection. You may need investigations like routine hologram, random blood sugar, semen culture and sensitivity. You may need to take antibiotics based on culture and sensitivity report. Motility is slightly low. Normally it should be at least 55 %. Your findings suggest over all 45% motility, so it is low. Sperm count is normal. It should be at least 20 millions/ml. Fertility is expected to increase with control of infection. If infertility persists then you may need assisted fertilization techniques. Get well soon. Take Care Chat Doctor."
my eight year old son has been sneezing every morning for the past couple of weeks and has very runny eyes too - he hasnt got a cold - i have been buying over the counter medicine for hayfever but tonight his eyes are all puffy and runny - is there something else i could do to relieve these symptoms,"Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in child Chat Doctor.  For cold, you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. For cold, you can use Cetirizine at 0.25 mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days. For nasal block, plain saline nasal"
"My dad (60 years) has kidney failure for one year now (both kidneys damaged) due to wrong medication received from a doctor, he was on pd for a few mths after his catheter was infected, he has now began doing hemo once again after a surgery to get his fistula running. For about 6 months or more he has a severe cough that isnt going away, what can we do?","Hi, Please get at least a Chest X-ray PA view done. Also, a few tests like CBP with ESR might be contributory. If there is no major problem as seen on Chest X-ray, he might improve with symptomatic treatment alone. Also, I hope his cardiac function is normal. In some patients with borderline cardiac dysfunction, the heart status gets worse after a fistula has been created, and this could contribute to cough and breathlessness.

My freinds dad has Creatine 2.5 last month.....4rm 2008 to 2012 creatine level went from 1.8 to 2.5.....so we consulted Kidney specialist dr......he sugested Keto Alpha & Synprotik 4r kidney.......Synprotik 1----1-----1 & Keto Alpha 2----2------2... after 1 week with low protein diet & above tablet his creatine level went 4rm 2.5 to 4 in 1week...is anything wrong or is it going right. please help me...i am confused & afraid....please help me,"Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Stop the dam stuff. Keto amino acids have not been proven to be of any benefit at all, but still widely prescribed in India (no where else in the world can people be fooled like here!!). At the very least it should not cause any harm. However, if the Creatinine has jumped up so quickly, something is wrong here, and it might/ might not be the new medicines that you started. Many medicines can cause a kind of inflammation in kidneys called Interstitial Nephritis which can cause sudden deterioration in kidney function (especially in those with suboptimal kidney function). The cause of deterioration might be something totally different - hence very important to get back to your)or another) nephrologist and get yourself checked out. Bur stops the new medications straight away. Best wishes"

"Ive had some swollen nodes on my neck for around a year now. I consulted 2 doctors and one of them strongly was against biopsy. So we decided against it. Im 18 and since it didnt go away yet. we went for another doctor. He suggested an ultrasound. There was splenomegaly and I think there was some swollen nodes in the abdomen too. I was tested for TB and it came back negative. So, Im guessing when I go in tomorrow for consultation, hed say I have lymphoma. So this is my question. How curable is lymphoma? How much time does it take for it become terminal? Thank you in advance. Id love if you reply fast. Its 1 AM here and oh, Im scared bad.","Hi, thank you posting at Chat Doctor. I can understand very well your concern, I recommend being sure if it is lymphoma malign you should make the following tests:1.  Lymph node biopsy(total excision of a lymph node that is then examined under the microscope)2. FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization).3. Specific blood test(It is realized by laser). The results of the tests will determine the diagnosis and the treatment. You need to make those to test because they are necessary. But is the possibility that you don't suffer from lymphoma, but from an easy form of this disease. Best Wishes."

"Hi, my mother is suffering from severe stomach ache which started three months ago, she is not able to eat any solid stuff, her condition is deteriorating day by day, after several tests doctors have  diagnosed her with Stage 3 Colon Cancer though her Biopsy report is pending, doctor has asked me to go for PET Scan as well to get things more clear, I request you to please suggest me if surgery is possible in her case or chemotherapy is the only option left, or if both are required.I have uploaded the CT scan, colonoscopy report, blood reports for your reference.please suggest.","Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Stage 3 means that tumor infiltrated colon wall and surrounding lymph nodes - it means that surgical procedure is possible, but it can only remove microscopically cancer and involved colon. It can also remove lymph nodes, but it is not possible to be sure that cancer isn't spread already. So if ct and PE done show any metastases then surgery should be definitely done. Chemo can be started after surgery. Buzt if there is evidence of cancer outside colon then the behemoth should be done first Hope I have answered your query. Wish you good health. Regards"
my six year old has had a fever of 104.5 for 24 hours and doesn t have any other symptom we have been giving him Tylenol and ibuprofen and the lowest his fever got was 102.0 should I be concerned? what other things should I look for? after four hours of receiving the Tylenol or advil his fever goes back up from 102.0 to 104.0 so waiting the other four hours with his temp being at 104.0 scares me because I can only give it to him every 8 hours.,"I share your concern. Fever in a sis year old in the absence of other symptoms could be considered as viral fever. You can give Tylenol every 4 hours at 10-15 mg/kg dose. And also give tepid sponging. I would do some tests like CBC and Urine RE to find the focus of infection after a thorough examination of the systems. You look for symptoms like running nose, cough, pain on passing urine. I would in my clinical practice try an empirical trial of antibiotics after careful evaluation. You can consult your doctor for further evaluation of your child. Hope I have allayed your fears.

Recent blood tests show elevated liver enzymes and I do feel abdomen tenderness and swelling. Obviously, I have attempted diagnosis with my primary PA and urologist.

I am trying to deal with bladder chemo first befor getting into the emerging liver issues..what do you think?.","Hello, Our liver tests are only slightly elevated. In case of serious liver disease, these values are around 1000.  The reason for your results can be a fatty liver which is present for sure if you are overweight.  Please note that untreated fatty liver (which is a reversible condition) can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver insufficiency. To reverse fatty liver process, you need to change your diet and lifestyle. Fatty foods, spicy foods, fired foods, painkillers should be avoided. Otherwise, this process will slow-going forward.

Dear Layman if this burning sensation has started recently it would be better to get a blood sugar levels tested, since diabetes is one of the main causes of peripheral neuropathy.

Is there anything i can do? please help","Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor I would keep a possibility of seborrhea dermatitis, it can present clinically as red scaly patches on the sebaceous gland rich areas like the scalp, face, chest etc., I would suggest you to use a moderately potent topical steroid cream e.g. fluticasone propionate cream twice daily for the initial 2 weeks. As seborrhea dermatitis often recurs and since it is not advisable to use topical steroids on face for long therefore after the initial 2 weeks steroids should be replaced with a topical immunomodulator e.g. either pimecrolimus or tacrolimus, for maintenance of improvement.

"Hi, I once had a hemoglobin number of 5.6 after surgery and they gave me 10 units of blood and the number went up to about 8.5. Then they released me from the hospital. I was carted away in an ambulance, could not walk, and spent the next three weeks in some kind of nursing home facility where i continued to recover. Did they release me from the hospital too soon?","Your Hemoglobin levels seem to be low but that can have a number of causes. From the history that you have given, it is not quite clear if your hemoglobin levels were decreased prior to surgery or after surgery. Also, only low hemoglobin levels by themselves are not always the criteria for inpatient therapy and a hemoglobin of 8.5 is quite compatible with discharge. But then again, we are not quite conversant with what condition you have been suffering from and what surgery was done. So it will be naive to comment whether you were discharged too soon."

I have diogonized last week with an after meal blood suger 220md/dl and been adviced by my doctor to start glucopeg 500mg. Since I feel that I am in good helth I ignore the sugeion to take medicine and went to another hospitel yesterday to check my FBS and PPBS and which was shocking !.. FBS is 126mg/dl  & PPBS is 96mg/dl !! Is it possibel that PPBS is lower than FBS and also I would like to know that my reading are sound good or do I need to start taking medicine for diabtec. Thanks in Advance. Regards,Your after meal sugar 220 mg/DL is definitely high. Next time reading is 126 is also high. Cut off value is 126. Between 100 and 126 FBS is called borderline and 126 is diabetic. It sometimes happen that pubs may be lower than fasting. However no need of starting antidiabetic medicine. First thing to do is you control your diet. And after that check it repeatedly at 15 days interval. If it remains persistent high then go for medicine. Consult your physician and take treatment accordingly.

"I have a nephew who has a hemogioma on his tongue.  He is right at a month old.  They live in Little Rock Arkansas.  The specialist who have seen him placed him on steroids, with no effect.  They had scheduled surgery to remove the growth, but minutes before the surgery, and after conferring with other doctors, they decided to place him on a high and low dose steroid to see which direction to go due to his age and the location of the hemogioma.    He was on the heard medication that is new and it caused him to be very sick and that is why the drs opted to take him off and schedule surgery.  My sister and her husband are so flusterd because they feel as if they are getting the run around on their babies care.

"My grandaughter had a water infection when she was 5months old she has been on antibiotics since she is 8months now. The doctors ave said she cud be on them until the age of 4, she has also had 2 scans on her kidneys but have both been ok. Why is she on antibiotics for so long","Hello, It is challenging to come to diagnosis with a limited history provided in the query. However, the use of long term antibiotic therapy is called for patients who suffer with immunodeficiency. The antibiotics prevent the risk of acquiring recurrent severe infections in such patients. As you have mentioned your grand child is five months old; it is likely that she is suffering from some form of rare congenital immunodeficiency. In this condition the normal infection-fighting system of the body does not function fully, making the person prone to severe infections. Apart from antibiotics other forms of treatment available for such patients includes antibody infusion, and stem cell transplantation. In addition, kidneys are usually normal as the immune cells are usually a component of blood.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
"Hello, my boyfriend has a tooth infection, he is taking antibiotics, but his next dentist appointment is not until Monday. The swellings that he had earlier from the tooth only got worse, not his entire cheek is extremely swollen. Is there anything that we can do to calm the swelling down?","Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The swelling over the cheek is because of the abscess or collection of pus secondary to teeth or gum infection. Consult an oral physician and get it evaluated. If I am your treating doctor, I would have suggested you to take radiographs like RVG or IOP AR to rule out gum and teeth infection. If it is a gum or teeth infection I would have prescribed a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin and metronidazole for 5 days (if you are not allergic). Then I would have suggested going for scaling and root planing for gum infection. Root canal treatment or extraction if it is a tooth infection. It takes two days for the swelling to come down following administration of the antibiotics. I hope my answer will help you, take care."

"Hello Sir, My cousin was diagnosed with brain TB some 2 months back.She was admitted in Alleppey Medical hospital and her condition worsened over the period of time. TB tests were conducted with no positive result. Thereafter, she was moved to Chitra Medical Hospital, Trivandrum and her samples were sent to NIMHANS for further study. Meanwhile, this period my cousin was losing her vision. A brain surgery was carried out and it was found that the vein supporting the eye sight was blocked and it was infected. The doctors are saying that she will lose her eyesight in a few months or so because of the infection. We really dont know if it s TB.Is there anything which we could do to retain her eyesight?","Hi, Thanks for writing in. The eyes are vital organs, and it is important to treat any condition threatening eyesight immediately. TB is a condition that can present with unique symptoms and involvement of the vein supplying the eyes is rare. Since a brain surgery was carried out, it is possible that the doctors took measures to safeguard her eyesight, but little could be done as there was a lot of infection. When there is significant infection, certain decisions have to be taken by the operating surgeon to protect the life of the patient and avoid further complications. To confirm TB or not you can send slides to research hospitals elsewhere in the country but the hospitals she has shown are well known for brain disease treatments. Particularly for her eyesight, it will help if you can request the eye surgeon to have a panel discussion with her neurologist."

He told me as my father was a chain smoker he got some problem in his lungs. However my father gave up his smoking habits around 10 years back.please give me some suggestion.,"Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion we need to rule out cardiac and respiratory causes for your fat fathers breathlessness. Since he was chain smoker we need to rule out COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). So get done chest x-ray and PFT (PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST) to rule out COPD. If both are normal, then get done 2D Echo to rule out cardiac cause.  As he is having aortic valve surgery, possibility of complication related to valve can be there. So consult your doctor and discuss all these."
I am 28 years old and my dr. has done several urine and blood tests to see why my toxins are so high in my body and my potassium levels are so high. He has yet to give me an answer as to what is going on I have read on here how bad high potassium can be do you have any suggestions for me?,"Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. High potassium level may be due to many reasons like hemolysis, high potassium diet etc. Potassium level is very sensitive and high potassium level can lead to life-threatening arrhythmia. You should control it immediately. Treatment of cause is also needed. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
"Hi, my wife is pregnant and is in 5th month. She is hypothyroid after our first baby. Recently, we got her checked for TSH which is on a higher side, probably 10. she is already taking 75 mg of medicine which her gynae has now raised it to 100. We would like to take advise from endochronologist if this is ok","Hallow Dear, TSH values up to 10 mid are quite high. You have to bring them down to the tunes around 3. Probably she is on Thermoform tablets. If even after 100 micrograms, TSH is not coming down, you have to increase the dose. The dose has to be titrated with TSH values. Please ensure that she is consuming iodized salt. Broccoli, Soda, Cauliflower, Cabbage are certain vegetables which interfere the absorption of iodine. So ask her to avoid them. It is always a good option to have Endocrinologists advice in Thyroid problem. However, please continue on Thermoform in adequate dosage. Low Thyroid functioning may affect the baby and/or pregnancy adversely. So please do not ignore. I hope this helps you."

Anyone with any suggetions or advice or clues to what this might be. thank you all so much.","The diabetes needs to be gotten under control immediately!!!  You need to eat 4-6 SMALL meals per day--good protein, veggies and fruit.  Watch your sodium intake (especially be cautious of processed foods--canned, frozen, etc.-fresh is best).  Chat Doctor.

"Hello, I am a 41 yrs old female.  55 @ 230lbs.  I woke up with a metallic taste in my mouth and the right side of my tongue numb about 7 days ago.  I read on line that it could be gum disease which I know I have but my gums and teeth do not hurt.  Now the right side of my nose & eye runs non stop.  I went to the Dr. and she put me on antibiotics but it hasnt helped... this is day three of being on them.","Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The metallic taste could be because of the antibiotics like metronidazole. The other possible causes could be because of the gum infection or pus discharge. Consult an oral physician and get your teeth cleaned. IF you are taking metronidazole then your metallic taste will come down once you stop that medicines. Do saline gargling. I hope my answer will help you, take care."

"Hi Doctor,I am suffering from Urticaria since last Dec. Food allergic test conducted in your clinic on 24th Feb and in Marry Queens hospital on 30th March shows no allergic to any food except a doubtful reaction on white egg and mutton. How ever I was under full control of these items. Still the itching and hives appears always and even lead to angio edema some times with swelling of lips and difficulty in brething. I changed my BP/Cholestrol tabs which were using for the last few years. Can you please advise whether I need to undergo one more food allergy test or any other remedies.Your advice is most appreciated.ThanksSalim Shah, Trivandrum46Y, 170cm, 80Kg","Hi, Thank you for your query. I can understand your concerns. You are having Urticaria and angioedema. Causative allergens can be food as well as non-food protein. You can undergo serum IGE level & absolute eosinophil count. You can take H₁ antihistamines non-sedating agents such as loratadine, loratadine, and fexofenadine, or low-sedating agents such as cetirizine or levocetirizine. The addition of an H₂ antagonist such as sanitizing in conventional dosages may add benefit. A CysLT1 receptor antagonist such as montelukast, 10 mg/day also can be added. You have to continue for a longer period, as it may be seasonal. A short course of oral steroid (e.g. Deflazacort 6 mg daily orally for 7-10 days) helps in urticaria with eosinophil prominence, idiopathic angioedema with or without urticaria, or chronic urticaria that responds poorly to conventional treatment."

What can we do for her at home?  I dont know if she is running a fever or not, but I am wondering if she needs antibiotics at thid point.","**1. Since possible infection is suspected thus examination with ENT doctor is necessary for evaluation of swollen tonsils and lymph nodes in the neck.PS. It is rare for streptococcus bacteria to invade the larynx, thus can be safely excluded2. It will be good to have examination since the bacteria can travel from throat to middle ear through Eustachian tube, as such ENT doctor can prescribe you specific medicine [antibiotic] or even go for swab culture.PS. other complications which though possible but rare are: arthritis, meningitis, glomerulonephritis. [but have to be excluded with suitable examination and investigation]3. . Maintain good oral hygiene, rinse mouth after every meal, avoid smoking, tobacco chewing, spicy/fried foods, have warm salt water gargles. Take salt, turmeric and Amelia ribs in 6-6 gm quantity and mix in 1/2 kg water and after filtering, have gargles with it [when still lukewarm].

I m asking this question for my mother. She is 67 yr s old she weighs about 169 lbs. Her BP this morning was 146/110 but when she takes her BP medication the upper # of her BP comes down slightly but her lower # goes down to between 50 - 30 s. What s going on?,"Hello, This occurs due to age related changes like hardening of blood vessels. There is no focus and worry about lower BP, it's not that important. The blood pressure should be less than 140/90 MMH. Even the lower BP goes below 50 it's not a matter of worry, but upper one should be controlled.  She should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly thrice a day for one week then once or twice a week.

"on Saturday night I was rough housing on my bed with my cat. I started to slowly fall of my bed and I tried to stop but it didn t work. I ended up on my head on the floor and all my weight (I weigh at least 131 pounds) on my neck and my body went over my head and then my head popped up. So it was kind of like an extremely painful back flip or somersault, off my bed. The pain right now is probably a 15 on a scale of 1-10. I went and saw Ms. Will (the school nurse at my high school) about my neck and she said that in between my vertebrae was probably swollen and to go see a doctor if it gets worse. So anyway the pain was not that bad unless I tried to look up. At the end of the school day the pain got worse and I got a bad headache. ( I don t know if that has anything to do with my neck but in case it does there you go) My symptoms are: pain (really bad severe pain), swelling (in between vertebrae most likely) and reduced flexibility. What can I do for the pain? Ibuprofen doesn t seem to help because I tried and it helped my headache but not my neck. I take strattera for my adhd and I had a concussion in 2008. I am 14 years old and I am 5 feet 1 inch. I weigh about 131 lbs.","Hi, You have mentioned Severe pain in your neck region along with swelling and stiffness. All this actually points out to the pattern of Neck injury which you sustained which might have lead to all the three symptoms in your case. If you have localized Neck pain with no other symptoms like radiating leg pain, neurological symptoms like numbness, weakness, paresthesia etc., then in my opinion you can start with following recommendations for initial period of 2 weeks: - To maintain proper posture of your Neck while working and sleeping - If pain is more as it is in your case, then you can take a short course of an anti-inflammatory medication like tab Diclofenac etc. along with a muscle relaxant for 5-7 days, you can add antacid if you have issues of acidity after NSAID intake - Physical therapy like use of some modalities etc. can be initiated, but no exercises till the pain subsides completely - Ice packs can apply 3-4 times in a day - Analgesic spray for local application can be used and is easily available - Avoid lifting heavyweight/ acute forward bending in mornings etc. We will observe you for next 2 weeks how you respond to this conservative management protocol, you can also use a soft cervical collar if movements in the neck region increase your pain, but from my side if you have no neurological symptoms, then we can follow this protocol for next 10-14 days. If you do not feel better in terms of pain, swelling and stiffness etc., then we will have to get some investigations like, dynamic x-rays of Neck and few blood tests for evaluation.  Just also keep me informed on what medications you are taking because unless you take proper pain management medications, your pain won't become better. Do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further assistance. You can also discuss your case and treatment plans with me in a greater detail in a private consultation.

I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of allergic bronchitis is high in your case. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. PUT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS).

Taking all the precautions with diet. No improvement. please advise. Thanks",Gout is the disorder of purine metabolism. It will lead to high uric acid level in the blood. Later on its crystals are deposited in the joint and produce pain. So allopurinol is the perfect Chat Doctor.  it's will increase the excretion of uric acid. Take NSAIDs as and when required only if plan and inflammation is there. And take low protein containing diet. It will help you to decrease uric acid level. And regularly check uric acid level. And change the dose of allopurinol accordingly. But it's the perfect medicine that you are taking.
"Hello I am a female 43 years old. Have had a PE about 6 years ago. I have 4 gene mutations wich are MTHFR and PAI-1. I have an Ivac filter in my vena cava. I have had chest pains for a long time now ,been to emergency rooms countless times. they never find anything. I recently moved to a very remote area and dont have any Specialty Drs. here. I last saw my hematologist in Dec 2012. He said he thought it was showers of micro clotting and to double up on my asprin and folic acid every other day. That worked for a few months but know the chest pain is back and it moves around and is very unsettling, it also seems to get worse with my menstral cycle. I dont know what to do anymore. Any suggestions?  I have to pay to get an answer? Figures","Hello..... As your details it seems that you are suffering from Congenital hypercoagulable disease. In this case, the blood getting thick day by day and causes clots at any site. Most common is lower large vein due to more stagnant condition. This clot frequently embolizes to chest and causes chest pain that is called Pulmonary embolism. With your description, you are suffering from Chronic pulmonary embolism that also causes right heart chamber enlargement and bilateral leg swelling. But you did not mention regarding breathlessness and leg swelling except chest pain on and off. Definitely this chest pain is due to microclot in pulmonary vessel. But the treatment you are taking is very ineffective. Aspirin is not enough alone to prevent the clot formation and keep the blood thin. So my advice is to start Tab Action with lower dose 2 mg once a day along with aspirin with folic acid. And do your Prothrombin time (PT INR) at regular interval of 15-30 days to keep your INR 2 to 2.5Thank You"
"Hi, My husband had been diagnosed with an elevated count of bilirubin i.e. 2.07. His SGPT level also increased to 100. Doctor advised him bed rest and home made diet. I have controlled his diet and he is taking rest. A month after, we have again conducted blood tests and now the report shows his bilirubin count to be normal. But there has been an increase in his SGPT level. It has shot up to 131. I cant understand what to do. Please advise.","HelloIncreased SGPT may indicate liver injury. It may be due to many reasons like hepatitis, alcohol intake, altered lipid profile, medicines,autoimmune causes etc. It may be related to hepatitis in your husbands' case as bilirubin level is also raised. You should allow some time for SGPT to become normal. He may need few more investigations like viral markers, ultrasound of abdomen. I suggest tablet ursodeoxycholic acid 300 mg twice daily for three months to my patients. It helps in regeneration of liver cells. Get well soon. Take Care Chat Doctor."

Your young age and the lack of history indicative for pulmonary disease suggests that you might be suffering from stress. There are some tests that you can run in order to be sure and help recover from this stressful situation.

"Am 23yrs female and am married,my problem is pimples n am having that for the past 3 yrs...am using Erytop cream and Keto soap for the past 1 yr but still am suffering with pimples n scars...i need a remedy","Hello, pimples have become a lifestyle disease & a disease of metropolitan cities...we hardly see them in villages. But can also be because of hormonal disturbances in our body, esp if it increases 2 days prior to periods. Never use a moisturizing cream on face. Avoid using oily soaps too. Use specific anti acne soap like Accela or decade acne soap twice a day. Use radiant cream over pimples in daytime and adhering at night. This might help you a lot.Nowadays there are very good tablets available for pimples but should be taken under dermatologists' supervision only. They can be either azithromycin or isotretinoin tab. Hormonal pimples can be treated with oral contraceptive pills. They are very effective and safe. All these needs blood test before taking them. Along with this u need to take 10-12 glasses of water per day & a good sleep. Regards, Chat Doctor."

As you already have DVT in your left leg, undergoing a spinal surgery may aggravate or worsen the DVT and even there are chances that you may develop pulmonary embolism.

"I have all my teeth hurting for two months. Have been to dentist. Also provider. No answered. I have had three cortisone shots for my shoulder pain. Two in April, one in September. I understand that a risk of cortisone is malofascile syndrome.could this be my answer?","Hi. Thanks for the query. Well, Myofascial pain is mainly in the muscles and yes, it can cause mouth pain also but if pain is localized to teeth then it can be either generalized gum Infection, if pain is in upper teeth and gums then it can be due to Sinus Infection or Sinusitis. So my suggestion is to consult an Oral Surgeon and get evaluated. A full mouth x Ray should be done to rule out the exact cause as it will help in evaluating your teeth, jaw, sinuses etc. For now if pain is severe you can take painkillers and muscle relaxants. Take soft diet and avoid stress. Hope this helps. Regards."

Any issues with testicles or hormones.? I presume that there must have been a reason for low testosterone and hence you were prescribed. NOW, clomifene can increase a pituitary hormone called LH which indirectly can stimulate testis to produce more testosterone if your LH was low previously. There should have been a low response from your pituitary gland and clonidine would have stimulated it. This possibility can be confirmed by testing your testosterone. Hope you are convinced.

Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care"
"My daughter is 4.4 years old, 21.8 KG weight. she has fever of 102.3, and my doc has prescribed Lariago 10 ml 2 times for 3 days, and Meptal-P 8 ml twice a day for next 3 days. We are in Hyderabad, India. I had malaria symptoms and undergoing treatment for the past 3 days, had high fever - 104, 184 was my sugar level, and low BP too. Since today evening my daughter who is very close with me, has been developing fever, and hence the medicines. Pls advise what would be the best way forward on my daughter s health.","Mariano or such antimalarial should not be given without confirming the presence of malaria but since it is already being given, you need to complete the course as prescribed. Metal P contains metonymic acid and is effective in reducing fever. Viral fevers are very common and could be transmitted to your daughter. Give her metal P or paracetamol syrup to reduce the fever. You may give sponging with water at room temperature. General health and hygiene measures and proper diet is all that you and your daughter need."
"My asthma was controlled over 2-3 years ago, but then it came back recently. This week I had two asthma attacks already, and my symptoms are difficulty breathing, extreme numbness/ tingly hands and I felt lightheaded and dizzy. I never had an attack like this years before when I was first diagnosed, before it was like I had asthma but never really had an attack, i just took medications to control and maintain. But now its a different story... Ive notice even just carrying my bag makes me want to catch my breath. My doctor prescribed me to take sertide (salmeterol + fluticasone) and asmalin/ventolin (albuterol/ salbutamol)... But I think the dose is low because my asthma isnt controlled.. I took prednisone 20mg when I had an attack and it got better really fast, however with seretide, not so much, even with my asmalin/ ventolin.. whats really wrong with me?? is this asthma? or what is this? :( i hate the attacks! I cant concentrate in school..","Hi and welcome in Chat Doctor. I have gone through your concern. According to the history your asthma is not well controlled. You have had several attacks in a short period. In this situation the treatment should be one step up. It means aerosols with corticosteroids + long acting bronchodilators, corticosteroids orally for a maximum of two weeks and after that to switch in Sere tide again twice per day and Ventolin for the urgency. If you have allergic asthma you can try montelukast for approximately 2 months, but please consult with your doctor for the treatment. I wish you a fast recovery."

Hi During my first pdelivery 3 years back I was diagonised with cholestesis (heavy itching in the 9th month) and hence had an C section..I remember my doc saying then that I need to take care when I take any birth control tablet. I would like to take an ipill today as I do not want to be pregnant..Is it safe for me to take it ? I am 31 years old 5 feet 2 inches and weighing around 65 kgs,"HiCholestasis effect is due to the hormone estrogen. That is why your doctor rightly advised against using birth control tablets. When she said this she was talking with reference to birth control pills containing both estrogen and progesterone.The PILL contains progesterone only. So you can use I PILL without worrying about homeostasis. Moreover, the progesterone is washed off from your body in few days. If you wish to postpone pregnancy I advise you to discuss with your doctor and use regular contraception. I hope I have answered to your satisfaction."
"I took my friend to the hospital emergency room about 4 days ago because of abdominal pain.  Her lipase level was 900.  She admits to drinking at least 6 beers every night.  She has also had stomach ulcers in the past.  The Dr in the hospital told her she needed to quit drinking as the high lipase levels were likely a result of excessive drinking.   Yesterday, her primary care Dr took blood tests again and said that all levels are normal but did not specifically mention lipase.  He thinks its her ulcer returning.  How do we tell whether its pancriititis or an ulcer.  She of course thinks its an ulcer.  Im concerned about her drinking.","Hi ! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. One fact is sure which you should specifically counsel your friend is to leave alcohol totally, as irrespective of whether it is pancreatitis or a gastric ulcer, alcohol is detrimental and the cause of both these conditions. The pain could have been due to pancreatitis de Nova or the gastric ulcer penetrating the posterior wall of the stomach to make the pancreas inflamed resulting in pancreatitis. In both the cases the serum amylase, and lipase could be increased along with alcoholism. However, high levels like a lipase of 900 points more towards a pancreatitis. If I were your doctor, after her condition is stabilized in the hospital, I would refer her to a gastroenterologist for a possible endoscopic evaluation of her old gastric ulcer. And I would also ask her for an absolute NO to alcohol to prevent further damage to the pancreas which sometimes results in very poor prognosis. She should continue with her treatment advised by the doctors of the hospital. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Chat Doctor."
"I am a 78 year old man, I have COPD, CHF and a multitude of other issues. I take up to 3 lasix daily and use lactolose and prune juice to regulate my bowels because I am on a 75mg Duragesic patch and supplement Oxycodone for pain from back surgery which cause severe constipation.

I am under the care of a cardiologists and multiple other specialist but haven t talked to them about these new symptoms.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, you are right about electrolyte disturbance as a cause for your new symptoms. Your symptoms like lethargy, muscle pain and weakness are mostly due to low sodium (hyponatremia) and low potassium (hypokalemia). So better to get done sodium and potassium level. The reason for this is mostly decreased urine output. This causes fluid retention. This fluid retention causes delusional hyponatremia and hypokalemia. It also causes weight gain. So better to consult nephrologist for electrolyte disturbance and decrease urine output. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."

"Hi, My wife and I are going through IVF due to MFI. We had two 5 day blastocyst transferred 9 days ago. My wife had a beta test 5 days after transfer and it came back 8.9 positive. The same day she started spotting which turned into a heavy bleed. When we called the doctor he was not in, and the nurse said that it was probably just the progesterone suppository not to be too worried, and had her switch to a different brand. We have another beta test today (9 days after transfer) and are hoping for the best, but are very nervous until we get the results. I have read so may stories with mixed results and the same problem. Is there any hope we are still pregnant?","Hi, It could be both ways, the bleeding if heavy could mean that implantation has not occurred, and she is not pregnant. The positive beta could be due to injections given for egg recovery. And It's too early to decide, a repeat beta Chat Doctor is required, and also you need to stay calm. Even if she is pregnant, the chances of miscarriage are slightly higher with IVF. So please be prepared and still hope for the best."

"Hi, back in the begining of November I caught what I thought was a cold. After five weeks of nose congestion I started taking Cefdinir. The congestion went away but in the half way through the antibiotics I began to get a dull head pain around my whole head. It keep me up at night. I could put my head on a pillow. After the meds, I went back to my general doctor. He told me I was getting better. But that night the pain was terrible. I called him the next day and told him something was wrong. He ordered a CT scan and found that I had a sinus infection in the frontal sinus and ethmoid (spelling) sinus. Since I am allergic to pennicillin, they put me on Cipro but later switched me to Biaxin. It has been slowly getting better, but I still have a dull ache around my head and nerviouness. It wakes me up a couple hours after I fall asleep. Could the CT scan have missed something or (since Ive never had a sinus infection before) is this part of the sinus infection?","HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor The dullness implies that the sinuses are still congested somewhat. In addition to the antibiotics, you would need to consider a decongestant and antihistamine. A topical and oral decongestant may help.

I can understand your husbands situation and problem. One should not start radiotherapy only on the basis of CT scan report. You need to have diagnosis of malignancy before starting radiotherapy. Since he is smoker, possibility of malignancy is high for this nodule. But we need to have tissue diagnosis first. Biopsy is not the only tool to detect malignancy. Rather for detection of early malignant lung nodule, go for bronchoscopy and BAD (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis to detect malignant cells. You can go for PET scan also. So first diagnose malignancy and then start radiotherapy. Ask him to quit smoking as soon as possible."

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.

Your pediatrician was right. The most common cause is constipation, which you have already treated. The other two most important causes could be mesenteric amenities, which could be because of non-specific reasons like innocuous viral infections and the other possibility is a kidney all gallbladder stone (if there is a family history this becomes all the more important).

"Hi, I was diagnosed with diabetes several years ago and was on metformin. Recently, I lost my health care and couldn t get metformin anymore, but then I also started a diet (it s not low carb or calorie deprivation-I eat @ 1300-1400 a day in 3 hr intervals) and have lost 25 lbs so far. I m still overweight, but I ve felt my sugar has been under control enough that, even though I have a few pills left, I haven t had to use any. Anyway, I ate my normal meals today, and right after eating dinner (fish & asparagus), I felt very faint and confused. I checked my sugar and it was 86. Is this normal? I haven t had any sugar symptoms since starting dieting except the other day, I felt like my sugar was high, so I took half a pill. First time in months. Could this half a pill have affected me that much? Is there anything else that would cause a low reading like that right after eating?","Hi, After going through your case details, I want to know-1) Your Age.2) Your Height and weight (It is very encouraging that you have lost significant weight with diet and exercise) to evaluate degree of overweight.3) Family history of obesity, diabetes.4) Current medicines other than metformin if any.5) Any associated high blood pressure or cholesterol problem. I would like to advise you - 1) Continue Low calorie diet and regular exercise.2) Better to avoid discontinuation or taking medicine on the basis of your own interpretation or symptoms.3) Quarterly check your HbA1c level that give much better idea regarding your diabetes control. Also check Blood sugar level Fasting and postprandial once in a month or two months.4) If it is feasible for you to do Self monitoring of blood sugar level (BSL done by glucometer at different times of the day (Fasting, 2 hours after breakfast, before lunch, 2 hours after lunch, before dinner, 2 hours after dinner, early morning sugar 3am) all sugar not daily but whole profile in a week at least once in a month. If there are symptoms of low BSL or High BSL you should confirm it.5) Regular BP check, clinical examination to rule out microvascular complications of diabetes (retinopathy - endoscopy, foot examination for neuropathy)6) Check your Lipid profile, it is advisable to take statin (lipid lowering Chat Doctor. 7) It better for you to take metformin in maximal tolerated dose, as it will help in reducing insulin resistance which is a basic pathology of diabetes. Metformin is weight neutral (may help in decreasing weight) and rarely causes hypoglycemia. 8) Depending upon your BSL control and HbA1c level other antidiabetic medicines that are either weight neutral or help in reducing weight can be added. Hypoglycemic blood sugar level in diabetic patient is depended on duration of diabetes, control of diabetes, associated complications. At blood sugar level of 86 you have symptoms of low blood sugar level, so it can be hypoglycemia for you.Also, there are rare chances of developing hypoglycemia after taking metformin alone."

"So, this happened awhile ago and it stumped doctors all over the city. Even the emergency doctors: I started taking diet pills and women s vitamins. I remember it all started with going to a perfume store and putting an oil based perfume behind my ears. Later that night I had a bumpy rash behind my ears (I m have never had an allergic reaction in my 21 years of life, not even dermatitis allergies)...a couple days later I was feeling sick and spiked a fever, then I developed a rash all over my face, little red bumps. Soon in turned into a petechial rash, all across my face and neck. and some spots on my arms. I went to the ER and they took blood tests which showed my white blood cells were fine...and recommended me to a dermatologist thinking it was a contact derm problem. They said the petechial rash wouldn t have occurred from a derm rash that occurred from the oil based perfume. I also was itchy as if I had the chicken pocks. I have gotten the rash once again since then...not the petechial rash, but the little red bumps all over my face. It seems to happen when I take women s multi-vitamins. But, I m taking them again and have had no issue. What could this have been? I m a 21 year old female who exercises regularly and has a healthy diet. I have no diseases, although I do have rh- blood and ovarian cancer runs heavily in my mom s side (she passed from it). I don t consume alcohol or drugs, so that s not a possible explanation.","Hi, According to me, you are suffering from Allergic contact dermatitis which could be due to your perfume. If your platelet counts are normal, you need not worry about petechial.  Main line of treatment is avoiding the causative agent, supplemented by topical and oral Chat Doctor.

"i had sarcoidosis earlier & doctors gave me steroid for that at a very high dose. now i have stopped taking steroid but i am suffering from so many side effects of it such as weight gain, frozen shoulder, lower back pain. can u please tell me how to overcome these. my age is 53 years & my name is rita my height is 4 11","Hi, Long term use of steroids sometimes causes some side effects but since now you have discontinued it the side effects will some be overcome. (I hope you have discontinued it only after consulting your doctor as per the requirement of your basic disease). Now for your existing symptoms like low back pain, weight gain, I feel you, first, get your calcium and vitamin D levels done. If they are low then you can try to increase calcium and vitamin D in your diet. Milk and milk products like cheese and yogurt are excellent sources of calcium. Even seafood, sardine fish, almonds, green leafy vegetables are rich in calcium. The minimum daily requirement of vitamin D is 800 IU units and calcium is around 1000 mg per day so that must be fulfilled. Avoid smoking and alcohol intake as they further increase the risk of osteoporosis. Go for some exercises like walking, running, swimming.  This will help you reduce weight and strengthen your body.be careful about your diet and avoid eating fatty food or junk food. Besides, I feel if this does not work out go for some other investigation. Get your complete blood count, done like TSH, cortisol, electrolytes done, so that we can reach a proper diagnosis. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further."

Do things you enjoy. I also suggest checking your eyes to ophthalmologist, headache is due to eye problem also. If problem continue than consult a good physician for this.

"My father has been a smoker for 50 years. He saw a doctor regularly. Anyway, two weeks ago, he met with a new primary doctor who ran some tests. They found he had an 8cm aortic aneurysm. He had a procedure last week (like a few days after the initial finding ) and had that repaired/stented I believe. Another test he had done with this new primary showed two spots on his one lung (one spot was on a lymph node?). It was pretty large. He has to wait to be released from the vascular surgeon to have a biopsy on his lung. He is scared to death obviously (and quit smoking this week). Anyway, the other day he went to have his bandage changed and a doctor ran blood tests..and also gave him an antibiotic saying that his incision was pretty swollen still (hemotoma)....and I guess he gave him the antibiotic to help with that?? Anyway, the blood work came back and his white blood count is high. What does all of this mean? 2 spots on lung and now high white blood count. Could the spots just be...incidental and the high WBC be due to an infection (or does the WBC mean worse cancer? There were only two spots on one lung...so could it have traveled to other parts the body already if is indeed lung cancer?","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion high WBC count is due to infected hematoma. It is known as SSI (Surgical Site Infection). It is a kind of complication of surgery. So antibiotics are prescribed by doctor to control the infection. And about the lung spots, I advise you to get done CT THORAX with contrast. As CT gives excellent view of lung parenchymal. And appearance on CT will guide us whether biopsy is needed or not. Chances of malignancy is there since your father is smoker and old age. So better to get done CT thorax and SOS biopsy."

As temperature is very high, give lukewarm sponging repeatedly. Don't wrap the baby in thick rugs. The given antibiotics should reach a level where it can fight against organisms. To reach that level it needs minimum 3 days. You can properly judge whether the temperature has reduced or not by feeling babies tummy. So don't take tension.

My wife just had an arteriorgram via the wrist. She had chest pain and received relief with a nitro spray. She has been diagnosed with Atrial Fib. The cardiologist found a 30 percent blockage. He said this was not sufficient to cause her chest pain. Where do we go from here to determine what causes her chest pain?,"Hello and welcome to Ask a Doctor service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. It's unlikely to have chest pain with 30%, now there are two possibilities, one is gastritis which mimic heart disease and do respond to nitroglycerin spray. For that try tab pantoprazole once a day before breakfast. Also avoid hot, spicy, oily food. Avoid heavy meals instead have multiple small meals and don't lie down immediately after meals instead have walk for some time. Second possibility is blockages small vessel disease which is difficult to pick on angiography which will also respond to nitroglycerin spray. Hope I have answered your query.

But once you have sex with a female, passion and love overwhelms any other thoughts and gives you perfect erection. But if you worry too much, be apprehensive, take medicines unnecessarily, you may suffer more. Because all these erectile dysfunction is in your thinking. You never had any problem.

However, a proper clinical examination, an abdominal ultrasound and liver function tests could help detect whether you really got a liver abnormality or not, or detect something else if it really does exist.

"hello, My daughter is 2 years and 9 months. This year she has been suggested to many nasal infections which later revealed that her adenoids got bigger. the pediatrician recommended Nasonex spray every morning and Aerius syrup for allergies every night. I always seem to notice that she breathes through her mouth (i can hear her breathing when she is next to me), she drools (sometimes during the day but mostly at night) and her cough is still present. Add to that, I see her rubbing her eyes and she has puffy eyes especially in the morning (which proves that she does have allergies). How long should we undergo the treatment to feel the difference? Should we seek an ENT specialist for further investigations or just give it time since no complications are there? Thank God she is growing as she should, she eats well and plays also but some phoenics when she speaks are not very clear, and sometimes she stops in the middle of the word to breathe","Hi, thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. Your child is having adenoids which are causing obstructive symptoms. How is your child in mornings, is she hyperactive or excessive sleepy?, if so she is not getting enough sleep in night because of the obstruction, and also she is having symptoms in night, so its better you consult ENT specialist to look for the degree of obstruction.

"i.thanks for asking in Chat Doctor. As long as your menstrual cycles are ovulatory, the chances of your conception are high even if your periods are irregular. Ova far is Camphene citrate. It is given to induce ovulation. It is given every monthly. Furthermore, it is started as 50 mg dose and given for 5 days usually from the 2nd day of the cycle. If the response to 50 mg is not satisfactory, then your Chat Doctor.  After 2 to 3 months the dose can be increased to 200 mg. If this is not successful then one of the following ways can be adopted.1. Combination of Camphene with Human Chorionic Gonadotropin on the last two days.2. Genotropin for 10 days followed by Human Chorionic Gonadotropin on the next day.3. Pulsatile administration of GRH analogs like Javelin. The success rate of the above methods are around 90%. If these fail, then assisted reproductive techniques like Invite Fertilization (IVF), Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT), Zygote Intro Fallopian Transfer (GIFT) and Intro cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (CSI) are available to improve your chances of conception.

Please advise about noninvasive tests.The blood testing for Ig G and Ig M also does not confirm a recent infection.I have never been treated or tested before for this infection.I have been diagnosed with moderate anemia with HB of 8.9 and ferritin of 2.9. I would also like to know if IV supplementation of iron sucrose can be done instead of having to take oral supplementation as this does not agree with me and affects me badly.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative, bacterium present in the stomach.80 percent of individuals infected with the bacterium will be asymptomatic, but individuals infected with H. pylori have a 10 to 20% lifetime risk of developing peptic ulcers. Confirmation of the presence of the H. pylori bacterium can be determined non-invasively using a urea breath test or a stool antigen test. So, i would suggest you to go for urea breath test. But definitely the best confirmation can be done only by endoscopic biopsy followed by rapid crease testing histology with special stains, or culture. Yes, you can go for iron sucrose injections if you are not compliant with oral medications. But be sure that you take under your doctors' guidance, since it has its own side effects. Thank you"

Normally patients that receive tetanus shots in my experience complain of pain at the site of the shot. It is possible the pain is from the site of the shot, not your heart.

"hello, my gum is swollen on the last part near to my left molar. it was swolen i think because i usually chew something there. its the second day and its getting worse. ive taken amoxicillin and ibuprofen and the pain goes away for sometime but it will come back and still doesnt get better. please help.","Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The pain, swelling and limited mouth opening could be because of the gum infection over the wisdom tooth (periodontal infection leading to space infection). Consult an oral physician and get a radiograph done to rule the amount of space present for the tooth to erupt if space is there for the tooth to erupt then the gum covering over the wisdom tooth can be removed. If the space is not available then you have to get the wisdom tooth removed. Meanwhile you can take a course of antibiotics like metronidazole 400 mg TID along with amoxicillin 500 mg and ibuprofen for 5 days (if you are not allergic). Do saline gargling.

I am 16 year old girl suffering with acne breakout since i was 11 .My treatment is still going on... they are treating it with salicylic acid and has prescribed me vibact and azee 9500) tablets - 1 tab each for 6 days..due to pricking them i am having acne scars ...please suggest me to treat them soon so that i can enjoy my XXXXX trip with a clear and glowing skin,Treatment of acne depends on the stage and severity of the condition. Very good results can be obtained if you are under regular treatment-the duration of the treatment lasting from 6-9 months. The problem of relapse occurs because most of the time either the medicines are not applied properly or not applied for the needed duration or the treatment is stopped midway or irregular. Topical retinoids' application at night for six to nine months is needed for good results as that is the time needed for microcomedones population to reduce to low level please visit the nearest dermal who will decide the stage and chalk out a management plan for you. Also one thing you need to strictly follow is that you need to continue the medicines for at least 6-9 months if you want to get rid of acne for quite a long duration.  Regards Chat Doctor.

"I recently began having shortness of breathe upon any type of even the slightest cardiac output from working in the yard to running the vacuum over the last 2 weeks; I had a chest X-ray performed and upon the radiology report the only notation was Bilateral perihilarmperibronchial peribronchial predominat upper lobe infiltrates, Consider in differential granulomatousmdis disease or chronic less common airway disease; Ive never had a report of such and I feel certain Ive had a chest X-ray in the last year, which if chronic, should have been seen or notated then.Case History in short; Ive been on hemp dialysis 25 years this September, male 44 years of age, non smoker, with no other health issues other than the ESRF. I have always taken incredible care of myself and have earned my PhD in general medicine.  I recently have gone thru a divorce from my wife of 12 years which was literally here and happy one day, and completely psychotic and stressed the next and last 18 months of my life, which unfortunately led me into a life which I was not accustom to, in that my diet is weak and poor as is my exercise, and now ability to even think of exercise. The physical rated at which I was exercising prior to all this was private training with the local professional soccer team, and playin level 5 tennis, all on a minimum of 4 days or 16 hours a week, Ive never had any type of incapability to work out or work, although a HD patient the Sat 24+ years; this divorce has really taken it out of me, but I am just now coming thru it, and ready to get back to it.  I also have full custody of my 10 year old daughter, which she needs Dad to be close to 100%... This latest issue has really got me sidelined; Id like to add, I just found out Friday my over all Fe/Iron levels are way down.  Although I will not know the ferritn until Monday, my current total iron is down to 19, TIBC  is 218, TSat is 9.  I have a HGB of 13.0 currently which is a little low for me but hanging in there. I guess my query is whats this lung issue and is it something I should be looking into, or could it be simply a fluid issue, my medical training hasnt prepared me for anything such as this.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. PUT (Pulmonary Function Test) 3. Sputum examination for AFB (acid fast bacilli-bacteria causing tuberculosis). 4. CT thorax with Contrast. Possibility of tuberculosis (granulators infection), bronchitis and other bacterial infection is more in your case. So PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis. Sputum for AFB is must for detection of tuberculosis. Hemodialysis is a risk factor for tuberculosis. CT thorax will identify the infection if present. So better to first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. You may need antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Hope I have solved your query.

"Greetings, 5 days ago while was playing soccer i sprained my ankle. The next day it was swollen pretty bad and i cudnt walk in my normal posture. Since it has only become better. For 2 days i used Deep Heat, then Moov gel and today i started Fastum. Well my question is, even though i can walk well now, there is still a pain and im wondering how long it would talk before i could play soccer again? Im 21 years of age if thats required. Thank you.","Hi, Good that your swelling has reduced, but you need to be a crape bandage on your ankle to stabilize the joint. Any ligament sprain or strain needs 3 weeks to heal so till then you can't play soccer. Also try avoiding weight-bearing on your ankle as this will relay the healing process. Continue taking hot packs, this will help in pain relief. Since pain is bearable no need to take any painkillers. Also, when you start playing soccer start gradually (remember your ankle has just healed). Need to do some muscle strengthening of the inverters and ever tors of the ankle joint to prevent rein jury.

My one yr old son has had a fever since thursday (which was three days ago. Highest it has gotten is 101.8(under arm) he hasn t slept well and has barely eaten but he has taken fluids. He is very fussy ad was just in antibiotics for an ear infection. He recently had his 12mo vaccinations. I just dont if he is having a reaction to vaccinations or if there is something more going on here. Im calling our Peditrician tomorrow... Just wondering if I can find any answers sooner!,"Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

I am also on Zoloft and do suffer from anxiety as well as shortness of breath (from anxiety) but have never had this chest pain.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should get done ECG to rule out cardiac cause. If this is normal than get done chest x-ray to rule out pulmonary cause.

Is it OK OR some other medication can be tried ?","Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor. F.  You are getting itching of the body only after the bath, so you must be allergic to the things you are using to take bath. Like soap, shampoo, anything to add to water while taking bath.

Avoid using seafoods like fish, prawns, and crabs etc. I advise you to consult a dermatologist for diagnosis and treatment.  Wishing for a quick recovery.  Best regards."

No focal lessions seen. No evidence of any intrahepatic biliary dilatation. Portal vein measures 1mm and is normal. Common bile duct appears normal. Can you interpret it and give me an advise. Thank you so much.","HiT hanks for choosing Chat Doctor for your query. Age, gender, duration of the problem, alcohol or Chat Doctor. I have gone through your problem described in your case. Increased echo texture on ultrasound is reflected in the form of fatty liver (due to deposition of excessive fats). The first thing to be avoided is stopped consuming alcohol (if you are an alcoholic), foods to be avoided are oily vegan and non-vegan dishes, fast/junk foods, avoid using larger doses of Paracetamol. Your diet should consist of leafy green vegetables, fresh fruits, baked white meats like poultry, fish and eggs. You can also use olive oil, black seeds (Nigeria sativa) which have proven to be effective in preventing liver damage,"

They said she has a bacterial infection, she was prescribed amoxicillin, she has been on it 2 days. still has the fever. what should I do","Hi, Please let me know her symptoms in detail.  Fever is only a symptom and the physician always looks for the cause of fever and then prescribes treatment accordingly. Your doctor told you that your daughter has a bacterial infection.  What is the site of infection?  She may be having an infection in the throat, or in the ear, or it could also be a urinary infection. Girls are prone to urinary infections, and it should be ruled out, more so since she has a fever for 6 days.  Is her fever better after starting amoxicillin?  If so you can wait for a day more. If the fever is of the same severity, it is recommended that you visit your physician who will check up your daughter again and probably order a urine examination and blood tests to confirm the diagnosis.

And when can I expect this to stop??",Hello:)Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. You did not mention how long you were smoking. I appreciate your decision to QUIT smoking. It is a wrong concept that it will go away if you start smoking. It will get worse. You must be suffering a leukoplakia.

Lesion will subside on reducing irritation from tobacco. Regards.

I am having problem with shortness of breathe or discomfort for quite a long time. It looks as I am having arrhythmia. Some times it increases and other time it keeps just above normal and It never get normal very few occasions for short period of time when my heart beats normally I feel tremendous amount of relaxation and comfortness and I want it to continue but a little stress and nervousness disturb the heart rate and breathing process. Would you please suggest me what is happening with me is it about stress or something else?? What is its treatment if it cure with medication??,"Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you are having anxiety related symptoms. But better to rule out cardiac and pulmonary causes first your intermittent shortness of breath. So get done1. Ecg2. 2d echo3.  Holder monitoring (24 hour continuous recording of ECG)If all these are normal then no need to worry much for arrhythmia and other cardiac causes. Get done chest x-ray and PFT (pulmonary function test) to rule out pulmonary causes. If all are normal, then anxiety related symptoms appear more in your case. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. Avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm.  You may need anxiolytic Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright."
"I have two large mandibular tori (and a palatal tori, too). I had surgery two weeks ago, and got a long cut (more like a long, deep gouge) along one of the mandibular tori from being intubated. The cut has slowly been healing with white granulating tissue being replaced with pink gum tissue, though it has not completely healed yet. Ive been trying not to chew on that side, as eating irritates the cut. My jaw has been aching on that side the last couple of days. I went back to work recently and have to talk a lot (customer service), and I wondered if that has made the gum and jaw swollen. My bite feels a bit off on that side and the teeth ache if I apply pressure, though were not damaged as far as I can tell. Ive been trying salt water rinses and a topical anesthetic for canker sores, and taking ibuprofen for the pain. Should I be concerned about the jaw ache? Is it likely to be local inflammation from the cut healing?","Hello there, Thanks for writing your query, Your clinical history shows you have undergone extensive surgery to remove the mandibular Tori as well as palatal Tori. In such case, it takes a little longer time for the wound to heal provided there is no super infection so extreme care should be taken. Do not worry about the swelling and pain as it is a sign of healing.  I would suggest you to start with an antibiotic and analgesic course consulting your dentist, which helps in subsiding the swelling and relives post surgery pain.  Follow all the post surgical instructions and rinse the mouth with lukewarm saline or antiseptic mouth rinse. I hope this helps, take care."
My son was running in a cross country event when he started to have problems with his asthma. (This does not happen very often.) He completed his race and then used his inhaler. It took awhile to work and  his right hand began to cramp up and feel numb. His hand was not cold and when we pressed his fingernail it turned red quickly showing that there was blood reaching his fingers. After his breathing was under control the feeling began to come back into his hand and it uncramped. What could of caused this?,"Hi, Asthma problem may be the cause for his numbness and cramp due to decreased oxygen supply. Usually before any exercise or sports better to give one puff of inhalation Chat Doctor.  This will prevent his symptoms to appear.  Sports or activity may act as a trigger for asthma attack. Daily montelukast will also help in preventing exercise induced asthma. Hope this helps you. Feel free to ask for any further queries. Regards"
Was doing a little experiment with a pen by burning it I know it was stupid but happen last night while I was drinking with friends anyways I think Ive  inhaled some plastic I think my throat also is irritating and now got a bit of a headache also chest keep getting little pains aswell as my eyes feel a little saw can you help me please?,"Hi, thanks for the query to H. C. M. Inhalation, if any foreign body in lungs it will produce cough uninterrupted (bout of cough)If you have cough from this incident than inhalation of some plastic material could be imagined. If such type of symptoms are there than you have to consult a physician, and he will get a bronchoscopy of yours lung to find out any foreign particles in airways( pharynx, trachea, bronchus. If cough is not there than it might be a mistaken thing. Yours question is this that there are burning in throat and also irritation, these two symptoms are same things just to fear of inhalation of a foreign thing.2 ND reason may be some injury due to engulf of something in esophagus to stomach. Take an antacid with oxycetacain (local anesthetic) at the advice of doctor which give immediate relief. Please get one X-ray of abdomen to find out any plastic like thing in stomach (color X-ray)Regards."
"hi Sir,, i am 28 yrs old,having bronchial asthma. i am on inhaled corticosteroids( foracort 400 rotacap twice daily for about last 8 yrs,,) i notice increase in abdominal fat & probably some gynaecomastia. is it because of these steroids? i gargle everytime i use them. is it safe to continue till long? i heard steroids decrese libido on longterm use. are all these side effects possible to develop for me?","Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your query and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Side effects of corticosteroids are numerous - obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cataract, glaucoma, reduced immunity, gastritis, reduced libido, osteoporosis, personality changes, etc. etc. However, such side effects are more commonly seen with oral steroids. They are seen only with long term use of high dose inhaled corticosteroids. Gargling after each use also reduces absorption of steroids into body as you have been already doing.2. Common side effects of inhaled corticosteroids are oral thrush, change in voice, local irritation, etc. 3. However, it is always preferable to try to reduce dose of inhaled corticosteroids as much as possible. Were I treating you, I would add montelukast in your regular treatment, which may reduce your inhaled corticosteroid requirements.4. I would also suggest you allergy testing, which will help you identify the substances causing symptoms to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.5. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve your allergy symptoms.6. Regular breathing exercises and a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc.) will also help you in a long run by improving your lung capacity and immunity respectively and thereby reducing inhaled corticosteroid requirements on a long run. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you the best of the health ahead. Thank you & Regards."

There was bleeding at site means it is a category III wound. If you have taken full course vaccination within last 2 years, now you just need to take 2 intramuscular doses of Raipur vaccine as on day 0 and day 3. Previous complete course of vaccination implies 5 intramuscular or 4 intradermal doses with 1 booster at day 90. Hope I answered your query. Any more query is welcome."

Sorry to here about your miscarriage. As per WHO guideline It's recommended to wait for six months, but as per new study it was suggested the sooner a woman conceives again, the better her chances of having a healthy pregnancy. One very important factor is to reassure yourself that the next pregnancy is likely to have a positive outcome. You must feel yourself physically as well as mentally ready for next pregnancy and of course you are the better person who can decide whether you are ready for next pregnancy or not. Hope my words will help you to decide the correct. All the best. Chat Doctor."
my child of six months having fever from last sunday. initially doctor has suggested crocin syrup then amoxicylin with crocin with no improvement in temperature which is hovering around 102 today doctor has suggested meftal after two hours of one shot of meftal till no improvement in temperature what to do now,"Thanks for putting up your query at Chat Doctor. It would have been easier for me if I could see the reports of the blood and urine investigations that your doctor might have done. You have also not mentioned whether the baby is still exclusively breastfed or whether he/she is feeding well. I would have also liked to know about the frequency of passing urine and whether there is cough. If you let me know these details, I would be able to help you better. Most of such fevers are viral. Since you are already giving antibiotics, I would suggest you to wait and see if the fever comes down. If the baby is not feeding well, it might be better to hospitalize the child. Metal contains Metonymic Acid which is prescribed for stopping bleeding. Your details are not enough to estimate the source of bleeding that your doctor is suspecting. Please get in touch with your doctor and discuss or get back to me with the details and I would try to help you further."
"Yes, please. I have a temporary crown that was put in two weeks ago Monday.  I have been taking Aleve and Advil independtly, these last two weeks.  This morning I took a 12 hr Aleve at 6:00 am and my mouth is not feeling to good right now.  Can I take Tylenol or Advil to help eliminate some of this pain?","Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint if you have a temporary crown over your tooth since 2 weeks, and you still have pain it is not a normal finding and needs consultation with a dentist to rule out the cause of pain. As of now you can take Advil [Ibuprofen] for relieving pain rather that Tylenol as Advil is more effective in reducing pain and inflammation. I would like to give you additional information that if after 2 weeks also you have pain in the tooth with a temporary crown, you need to consult a dentist and get evaluated and also get an IOP AR [x-ray] done to rule out the exact cause of pain. At times high points over the crown can be a cause of pain and trimming of the same can relieve the pain. Other causes can be:If the tooth is root canal treated before crown placement there re-infection in the tooth can be a cause of pain and in that case removal of crown followed by repetition of root canal treatment followed by antibiotics and painkillers and replacement of crown will relieve. If root canal treatment was not done there is a possibility that while preparing the tooth to retain the crown there have been some nerve exposure and inflammation of nerve is causing pain. In this case root canal treatment has to be done after removing crown and then crown has to be replaced. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor."
I am suffering from pain in the legs and sometimes in hands. When I start walking I get heaviness in the head. I have done my MRI brain Scan plain which is normal. My protein is high 1.8. I have done my rheumatic arthritis test which is normal my b12 is around 1052. My doctor has suggested evion tab,"Hi, Without an exam, I can only give general information, Lets start with atypical angina would be heaviness in the bottom part of the head. That is pretty common! Typical in the textbooks is heaviness or dull pain in the neck with exercise with shortness of breath. That would be a serious symptom that could imply the risk of a heart attack in the immediate future. Pain in the legs, however, is pretty much never heart. And overall poor exercise ability would cause all of this. So, the treatment is more exercise BUT, there would have to be an evaluation and likely a stress test before it would be safe to recommend. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
"For 17 months, Ive had off and on problems with numbness, tingling and pain in the left foot. At first it was also in the calf and so we thought it was a calf strain plus nerve radiculopathy from my low back (Im permanently disabled post failed back surgery syndrome and nerve troubles). However, after the calf improved (6-7 months), I began to have the same problems in both the left AND right feet and ankles, radiating at times up to the right knee on the tibia and mid-tibia on the left. After seeing a second neurologist in February and getting prescribed Nuerontin and with no clearer diagnosis than it was somehow from the back (and no new testing), I began to question why for the past two weeks, its not only been worse in the evening, but it can be bothering me a lot in the morning as well. I looked Perindopril (ACE inhibitor) that Im on for hbp and saw that its not a frequent, but a possible side effect - muscle weakness, tingling, numbness, etc. It made me ask my regular doctor to do a blood test for potassium level and she also wrote for me to have a Doppler test on the calf. However, the symptom that started this morning is whats concerning me. A regularly, pulsating, short throb in the right calf. Feels like a heartbeat/small throb, but strong enough to be quite painful. Im to have the blood test done tomorrow, but the Doppler not until Tuesday. Meanwhile the leg keeps throbbing and I cant rest. What is it safe to take to help this? Im already on 1/2 patch of 35 microgram/hour pain med (Buprenorfin) and 1/2 mg Rivotril (Clonazepan) each night (+ 400 mg Neurontin at night) for the back/nerve pain, but thats not cutting the throb in the calf. Ibuprofen OK?","Hi friend, Welcome to Chat Doctor Ibuprofen is a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Chat Doctor.  But beware! - NSAID can have effects on stomach, asthma, blood pressure and so on. ACE can retain potassium.... Doppler for the veins is done for thrombosis (clot formation) / veins don't pulsate!  / If it is, it is a transmitted pulsation and the study should include arterial Doppler too.

How do I fix my problem. My face is broken out all over check and nose area. thanks,"Hi dear, As you mention in query that you have been prescribed antiviral Chat Doctor.  It means the bumps are result of bacterial infection or body is showing reaction to certain medicine. I would suggest you to consult dermatologist again and your surgeon who placed implant to discuss the condition. Doctor may prescribe antibiotics like minocycline or clindamycin. Till the give cold compresses to the bumps, use mild soap to wash the face with cold water twice a day. Also apply atelier acid containing cream which is very effective for pimples.

I have chest wall pain.. I was told it was inflammed and was given meds to help.  Along with that I feel light headed and dizzy.. I am aware of a heart issue I have.. I throw a lot of extra PVCs but have gone through a stress test and worn a king of hearts and the docs wernt concerned.  But I am worried because I continue to have pain in the chest if I stop the pills and I hate the light headed feeling .. what is wrong with me ???  Please help,"Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You are having premature ventricular contractions (PVC's). This is known as rhythm disturbances in heart. And it is mostly due to arrhythmia. Stress test is for Coronary arteries. It will not diagnose arrhythmia. And arrhythmia can cause chest pain, dizziness, light headdress etc. So in my opinion, you should get done Holder monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ECG) to find out the type of arrhythmia. You may need anti arrhythmia Chat Doctor.  If this report is normal then no need to worry about arrhythmia or other heart diseases. Sometimes stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution.

"i am 42 years old and only have a daughter who is currently eight years old. I have been tryin hard in vain to conceive. According to various doctors reports i have multiple fibroids inside my uterus . But despite this I managed to get pregnant even with fibroids and gave birth to my daughter through a normal delivery. I am desperate to have a baby or babies. Three days ago i was advised to use fertility pills which i should finish by saturday, and then proceed to using ovacare, kindly advice.","Hi there, After going through your question, I am of the opinion that:1) Fibroid do cause infertility, especially as age increases as well as size of fibroid increases.2) The reason that fibroid cause infertility are: a) They distort the uterine cavity and prevent implantation. b) Hormonal changes are caused which can prevent ovulation. c) Sometimes, they obstruct sperm transport and fertilization. d) They can cause miscarriages due to poor plantation.3) My suggestion is that you keep trying to conceive, but in case the pills do not work, you might need to get your fibroid removed by mastectomy and then plan for pregnancy.4) As it is, your age is also a factor in reduced fertility. As we grow older, our follicles reduce and there are a lot of hormonal changes too. A woman of 34 and of 42 are completely different. You should get evaluated for your hormonal profile too with tests like FSH, LH, AMH, Sr. testosterone and estradiol, TSH, T3, T4 and blood sugar and Sr. insulin. I wish you all the best.

Hi i jus got my wisdom teeth pulled the day before yesterday....2 on the top and 1 on the bottom right.

The pain on opening the mouth is due to injury to the mastectomy muscle while injecting the anesthetic deep in the muscle to numb the operating site.

"I had a birth control implant Implanon in my arm that was supposed to only be there for three years. but was there for five, I just had it removed a week ago and was curious as to how long it could possibly take to get out of my system and conceive a baby. I would assume it wouldn t take long at all because it was 2 yrs past due for removal and had probably had little to no chemicals left for my body to absorb but im not a doctor and don t know how that stuff works. Please help as we are very excited to try and have a baby and are very curious to a rough estimate as to how long it could take to get pregnant?","Hello, I would be happy to help you with your question. You are right, implant is supposed to remain in place for only 3 years, but there is a certain amount of hormone present that is still active for some time after that.  Over the last 2 years (you did not indicate) I would assume that you had some resumption of normal cycles?  Once you are having regular cycles (which might be delayed if there is still hormone in your system) then the chance of conceiving every month that you try is about 15-20%.  85% of couples will conceive within the first year off of birth control.  If you have irregular cycles, you need to talk to your doctor. I hope that this helps and good luck!"

I get constipation a lot sometimes and I feel like my bladder is not emptied every time I go to the bathroom. Please dont tell me to go to the doctor because I cant afford to.

I have observed that the symptoms were worst in winter but still I have above mention problem. Please help me.Should I change the medicine? Why I get panic attack whenever I have allergy attack with shortness of breath. Is shortness of breath a common sign of allergic rhinitis? Please help me to overcome from this.","Hello, I would like to make the following suggestions to you:-No, shortness of breath is not a sign of allergic rhinitis. At the most, nose block may create an impression that you are feeling difficulty in breathing. But if it is not due to nasal obstruction, it may be due to bronchoconstriction caused by reactive airway disease.-A panic attack can also cause a feeling of suffocation. In my opinion, measuring peak expiratory flow rate during the attack and after the subsidence of the attack is an easy option to identify the cause of breathing difficulty for you.-By allergy Chat Doctor.  It takes a few months (six months or more) for immunotherapy to become maximally effective, so I would suggest you continue it under the guidance of your allergist.-I agree with your treatment with Motion LC, nasal spray (intranasal corticosteroids) and allergy"
"Hello, My name is Robert. My Step son is a spina bifida patience and has a shunt installed which has been revised about 7 - 8 years ago. He has been having headaches for several days and was administered into the hospital and has had CT scans and X-rays performed as well as blood work done, with no signs of problems being shown. Before we administered him we tried Advil, Tylenol and Migraine meds that did no good. Now after him being here and being treated with Hydrocodone for 3 days and still no answers from the Doctors, his headaches have gone for about 18 hours. He is scheduled for another CT this afternoon to see if any changes are noticeable from the previous scans. My question is it possible that the absence of to much CF causing or possible causing these headaches and if so why now is he back to normal with no meds at all ?","Hello Robert! Welcome on Chat Doctor ! Considering the fact that he has a shunt, a shunt dysfunction could cause persistent headaches, probably related to excessive or low quantity of CSF. Anyway, a shunt dysfunction can be seen easily in a CT scan. Is his headache triggered by standing up position? This would indicate possible intracranial hypotension (from low quantity of CSF). A brain MRI is also necessary too, coupled with a lumbar puncture to exclude possible infection. You should discuss with his doctor on the above issues. Kind regards,"

So I have been on microgestin fe 1/20 for about 9 months. For the past two months I have not gotten my period and have only had brown discharge . I m usually pretty good about getting them for at least 2 days even if it s just spotting. I ve had migraines and such symptoms. I had taken a pregnancy test the first month I missed it and it was negative. Should i take another test?,"Hi, It is possible that the endometrial preparation has become inadequate and hence you have had only some spotting. If you have never missed any of the pills, pregnancy is very unlikely. In the current scenario, you should see a specialist for a complete clinical assessment and get a trans-vaginal sonogram along with a blood test for pregnancy. Urine pregnancy test is of not much use in the current situation. Your migraines may not be related to pregnancy; they may be pill-related. Hope you find this information useful.

"I had my jaw bone sawed for access to my squamous cell tumor mass at base of tongue, to remove the tumor , 2 lymph nodes removed & half of my tongue (which is now sewn to gum line so that I cannot swallow b/c tongue cannot reach roof of my mouth.

Cancer of tongue is treated with surgeries first and removal of part of tongue always brings complications in eating and talking etc. compromising the quality of life. The shooting pain you are experiencing on the back of the skull is due to the surgical procedure that may have cut the nerves invaded by cancer. Due to damage to the nerves, experiencing these shooting pain episodes is usual. You are taking opioid analgesic Morphine which should control the pain episodes. However, if that is not helping you, you should see a neurologist for invasive treatments regarding the nerve pain that will not require general anesthesia. I hope this answer helps you.

It seems to work well until I eat then the stomach pain and bloating comes back. Im tired o being miserable. Is this normal after taking Linzess?","Hello, thank you for your query.First, let me tell you that COPD may not have relation to this pain of yours. Secondly, the Chat Doctor. .

Erectile dysfunction (ED), sometimes referred to as impotence, is the inability of a man to achieve or maintain an erection hard enough for sexual intercourse.

Usually there are no green lesions of the oral cavity. This is very rare. However, it is possible that some green food particle such as pea or herb may have been pushed inside the gum by the force of tongue while chewing.

If your values were lower in the past than your implied high alcohol consumption may cause it, although this is usually attributed to malnutrition in alcoholic patients, that is reduced consumption of folic acid and B12 vitamin.

The typical symptoms of over masturbation includes chronic fatigue, weak erection, thinning hair, and depression.4T plus tablet is an ayurvedic preparation and can reverse symptoms due to over masturbation.

HiI have just come across this site. Is it free?!! I have had a biopsy of a red rash across my abdomen and arms and I have been told that I have morphea. I have ITP (variable platelet count of between 20 and 80 so no need for regular treatment) and had a B12 deficiency when I was vegan a few years ago but I am now vegetarian again and havent had my B12 checked for years. Could any of these things be connected? I would be grateful for any advice. thanks O.V.,"Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Vegetarians commonly have It B12 deficiency, but not necessary always. It B12 in vegetarians is usually produced in gut by bacteria. 2. Also, green leafy vegetables are rich in It B12.3. No, all of them are not connected. ITP is secondary to viral infection and usually affects only platelets. It does not affect It B12, neither does morphed.4. Additionally, during deficiency, you can take It B12 supplements or injections, which will rapidly improve it. Pernicious anemia will require evaluation, if it B12 does not get corrected after taking oral It B12 for a long time. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again."

"Hi DR. XXX, I am XXXX, 56 yrs. old. I go to the gym and do cardio exercises everyday. After workout I enter the Steam Room for added comfort. However, since 1985 i started having Asthma . It starts with a Cough & then Asthma comes in. Ventolin Inhalers comforted me until I switched to Symbicort Inhalers 4 years ago. Until Lately I switched back to Ventolin thinking that Symbicort w/ Steroid can Cause Throat Irritation and Severe Side Effects & Erectile Dysfunction as compared to Ventolin.With this, I would like to ask which is better to use Ventolin Inhaler or Symbicort Inhaler? I have been using Ventolin Inhaler before I switched to Symbicort Inhaler 200 mcg. Symbicort was good for me. I only take it once a day & sometimes after 2 or 3 days. there was even a time when a whole month passed w/out me taking a dose. I noticed that my chest tightness usually happens when my stomach is full after dinner at night. Lately I switched to Ventolin Inhaler again but its effect only lasted for about 12 hrs. before taking another dose. Now continuous cough due to irritation of the throat is what I experience before an attack. My throat is itchy & chest tightness follows. Will i just discontinue Ventolin & go back to Symbicort Inhalers? Or can you prescribed a better Inhaler for me? If so, what is the best medicine for me to take. Likewise, a medicine to stop irritation of my throat due to this Medicine. Your advice will greatly be appreciated. Thank you very much!","Hi, You are 56 years, you have asthma since 1985,and using Symbicort, you get tight chest, after dinner, switched over to Ventolin.  It is an allergic reaction, I prefer to give the patient montelukast, and levocitrizine combination for minimizing the attack, otherwise I prefer to give triamcinolone for preventing the attack.  With the help of these, you can greatly minimize the dose of the bronchodilator inhalers.  Ventorline is a short Chat Doctor.  Thank you."

"Hello, doctor,My wife is 7 months pregnant. Since last 3 1/2 years she is taking anti-depressants. During that tenure, thrice she was on the verge of coming out of medication but treatment was re-started after she again started showing depression symptoms. The most recent symptoms shown before re-starting medicine were constant pain of left side of head and anxieties and crying. Currently she is taking Nexito Forte. I have two questions? Currently, she is putting on more weight than required... can it be because of this medicine and will it harm baby?.  and secondly, being on anti-depressants for so long ....will it impact my wifes health in long-term and will she ever come out of taking anti-depressants?","Hi, I do not feel that the excess weight gain is due to Next Forte as all SSRIs, including Escitalopram which is the main ingredient in Next Forte, are known to cause weight loss. In my opinion, you must check her thyroid status as hypothyroidism can cause both weight gain and recurrent depression. Please also see if she is taking a diet too rich in fats. Regarding your second question, being on antidepressants for a long time is not expected to have any deleterious effect on her health in the long term. Most patients are able to discontinue antidepressants and I expect she too will be able to do so, provided it is done properly and at the right time. Hope this helps you. Best wishes."

During the Second trimester, you can either remove it or continue the root canal. Do not expose yourself to the X-rays. Tooth extraction and anesthesia is safe in pregnancy. Only thing is you must keep cool and not be anxious during the treatment. Regards."
"I have been taking the depo shot for about a year now.  About 4 days after getting the shot I will get symptoms that mimic a yeast infection: white clumpy discharge, itching and burning.  However, this isnt a yeast infection.  About 1-5% of women suffer these side effects from the depo.  My question is is there something I can do or a medication that I can take that will alleviate these symptoms?  They will last a very long, excruciating few weeks.","HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor Some women are more prone to have yeast infections. The following may help: (1)determine if there is underlying immune deficiency such as diabetes, steroids, other immune suppressing medications, HIV(2) probiotics-these may help to reduce the frequency of acute infection(3)using cotton underwear, cool clothes(4)you may need a prolonged course of antifungals hope this helps"

"Hi, my boyfriend is has this recurring rashes in his chest , neck , nape , arms. He went to a doctor once and they ran tests on him they said it is an allergy . They just prescribed him celestamine. He also used momate one time. According to him momate was effective. But momate was not really prescribed to him. I forgot the name of the other cream.. But he said it did not work as fast and as good as the momate cream. His allergy seems to be triggered by the cold climate. What should we do. He is now suffering from it again. He was not able to get a lot of sleep because of it. He said it is very very itchy.","From you description it appears a case of urticaria which is usually because of allergy. He should take an antiallergen like cetirizine or Allegra for 4 to 6 weeks and apply a soothing cream like calamine lotion. He should also deform himself with mental 400- 1 tab at night for 2 to 3 days. If the allergy is very troublesome, he may take a short course of steroids orally-something like omnacortil 20 MGM once a day for 5 days, or he may go in for allergy testing."

You should be investigated thoroughly to rule out all of overexercise, stress, anxiety, fluctuations in weight and age around 40 are chief causes. Polycystic ovaries can cause irregular cycles for which various hormonal assays are necessary for diagnosis. Thyroid disorder, a Chat Doctor.

However, you should consult a proper Infertility specialist, to get all investigations done, also your partners' semen testing and tests to know if both your tubes are open. As your cycles are irregular, it is extremely difficult to pinpoint the days of ovulation, around which, intercourse leads to maximum chances of pregnancy.

He was recently prescribed Lisinopril and he believes that is the cause of his problem.,"Hello, Lisinopril may indeed cause a headache in less than 10% of patients. This is a fairly common side effect. The leg pain and the rise in blood pressure are irrelevant to the Chat Doctor.  On the other hand, any kind of pain may cause the blood pressure to rise.

Hi. We have a 4 week old baby boy with a dilated renal pelvis . We give him antibiotics - Trimethoprim - everyday for this. Recently he seems to be suffering from trapped wind a lot and we were going to give him some gripe water but when we looked at the packet it said to avoid using where impaired kidney function exists. Please advise. Thank you,Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. I don't see why are you giving him antibiotics if he doesn't have reinfection. But ok. Dilated renal pelvis isn't uncommon and it usually doesn't cause permanent problems. It is questionable does he have impaired renal function because dilated pelvis doesn't mean that his renal function is affected. It should be evaluated by measuring urea and creatinine. If this is normal you can give gripe water. Wish you good health.

hello dr i am having infertility problem .my right tube is block and left one is partially open . i had my tb test done by menstrual blood test which was negative .now my doctor had prescribed me to go for tb treatment as he think tb to be the reason of tubal blockage .my prolactin is little high .what should i do .please suggest.,"Hi, Thanks for consulting us. This is true that Tuberculosis is very common in certain parts of the world. When this involves the genital tract, subfertility may result. I don't think it would be justifiable to start ATT (anti-tuberculous treatment) without confirming the diagnosis first. I think you should take a second opinion before starting ATT, as this is not a standard practice to start treatment without lab evidence of the disease & there are better treatment options to help women with tubal blockage. Women with borderline raised prolactin do not need treatment. So, better search for a good fertility specialist in your area. Wish you good health. Best of luck."

"So I have for pretty much three weeks, and I have taken care of myself and my body pretty well since I was diagnosed. But last night I was around a few friends at their house and the were smoking cannabis out of a tobacco paper a few times while I was there, but I did not partake in smoking but was sitting with them around second-hand smoke. There wasn t a window in the house open, and I was with them for 12 hours. I feel absolutely stupid now, for being around the smoke!! Will this worsen the pleurisy and should I go to the doctor and get checked back out again for further damage to my lungs? I thought if I couldnt feel the effects from being around the smoke it wouldnt affect the pleurisy, but man was I wrong at least I think?! PLEASE HELP!","Hi, Thank you for your query. I can understand your concerns. Second hand marijuana smoke can produce a very small high(contact high) in people, around those who are smoking. The high that the non-smoking individual feels is said to be caused by the smoke that is in the room.However, second hand marijuana smoke is unlikely to have any effect on pleurisy for that matter to worsen it. Significant decrements in pulmonary vital capacity have been found in regular daily marijuana smokers and marijuana smokers may develop bronchial irritation. Whether second hand marijuana smoke will affect by-standers lung similarly await study replication and confirmation. Regards"

"Hi, I had #15 tooth extracted 10 days ago, swelling in cheek led to my going to the dentist in the first place. Tooth extracted, continued antibiotics that I started 6 days prior to extraction so finished them 4 days after extraction was done. 7 days later swelling was minimal but now after 10 days post extraction, woke up with swelling on face from my eye down to my jaw. Went and saw oral surgeon, was told its cellulitis and  given augmentin  875mg for 10 days, follow up with him in 3 days. Wondering how long before swelling goes away?",Hi. Thanks for the query. Swelling on face after tooth extraction that was previously infected is most probably due to Infection spreading into the soft tissues leading to Cellulitis only. The time duration in which swelling will go away depends upon the severity of infection.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhea. I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D Chat Doctor.

Hi I got the Implanon inserted 2 and a half months ago and I ve recently started to get lower back pain.. I ve been taking nuerofen to help and Oruvail for any swelling but nothing seems to have helped.. Is there anything else I could get subscribed for this?,"Implant is used as contraceptive devise which helps for prevention from getting pregnant. And it also has many side effects. You can search for its on internet. And I suggest talk to your doctor regarding the lower back pain also. As well there are many other safer ways are also available to prevent pregnancy, so I suggest thinking on that option rather than this. Now for your lower back pain since it is only at back level looks like muscular pain, and you can take some painkiller along with muscle relaxant tablets. Along with this do take some physiotherapy treatment and follow spinal exercise for better result. For major back pain radiating to legs along with numbness, it needs to check with MRI of back to rule out other spinal issue. And based on the MRI report the treatment will be planned. Here it can be conservative with medical management for minor problem or surgical correction for major issues. Talk to your orthopedic doctor in detail for proper treatment planning. You can also use hot and cold pack on your back for some more relief by relaxing your soft tissue. Take care."

"dear docter my child (doghter )swallon the mosquito repllent oil last week .with in a hour he got lot of fits @(leg and hand or shaking ) also we send hospital and they are not assured to give any word and they told lot brain injury , how we recover my doghter",Reclothe toxicity is due to the parathyroid component and its oil base. Neurotoxicity is the most common toxicity after ingestion of mosquito repellant(due to parathyroid component). Due to its oil base there is increased chance of aspiration chemical pneumonitis. There is no specific antidote available. Antiepileptic medication along with oxygen or ventilatory support is the mainstay of management. The cause of brain injury in your child may be due to repeated seizures. Controlling seizure will help in further brain injury. The outcome will depend on the recovery over a period of time. Regards

However the flu like symptoms have continued and I can only ut it down tothe increased Losartin the GP gave me. I feel like stopping them just to see how I am (can t see the GP till after christmas) but don t want to go over the holiday feeling like I do either!,"Hello, Losartan does not usually cause the problems you describe, though rarely they can cause flu-like symptoms. So I would say it would be reasonable to try stopping it or switching to another medication, but I would at least try to contact your GP about this before doing it, to make sure your blood pressure or whatever other reason you are taking it won't be out of control when you stop it. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care."
"Hi I ve been experiencing for about the last week and a half pain in the middle of my abdomen (like cramps but not as severe), headaches daily, constantly having to pee, loss of appetite, tiredness all the time, and nausea without vomiting what could this be?","Hi. Thanks for your query. This is almost 10 days that you are suffering from the symptoms. You also have headaches daily-pee- no appetite, tired and nausea. This can be due to severe urinary infection.

This needs to be done before you start the antibiotic as a single dose can alter the pathology picture. The treatment will be composed of an antibiotic which acts the best for a urinary tract infection. The antibiotic can be changed by your Doctor is there is no response to one antibiotic and as per the reports of culture and sensitivity of the urine examination."
"Hello, I had a molar extraction in my upper right side on Tuesday of last week.  On Friday, I went back because I had a dry socket and was inserted a gauze with anesthesia.  Today I had to go back and get the gauze removed- the assistant scraped the top part of the extraction site to make it bleed again (it was the most painful experience), it bled, and was rinsed and cleaned out, inspected by the dentist, and I was sent home.  Now, in the evening, I have a grayish, white-ish film in the extraction site and a dark red dot or hole right next to it.  Is this normal? Please advise.","Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Read your query. It can be the healing site after applying medication to the socket. Take the antibiotic as your dentist has prescribed for you. If You smoke avoid it as it will prevent healing.Don't carry on vigorous forceful gargling. Do warm saline gargling. If the pain is persistent or the swelling is increasing, consult back to your dentist. Hope this was helpful. Thanks and warm regards."
"My wife has irregular periods since she was matured, however she got conceived within few months of our marriage and had our first baby. later I used protection for almost five years until she was diagnosed with Ectopic Pregnancy due to irreregular periods.Her left tube was removed and we tested her other tube using HSG and found to be normal.Her irreregular periods still continues and our Gyno prescribed DEVIRY tablet but no periods as its been 7 days of Deviry last tablet. Please advise on how to treat and we are keen on having another Baby.","Hello, As per the history, it looks like your wife needs to be treated for her irregular periods first with a complete protocol of investigations including a complete hormonal profile, glucose tolerance, infections and so on. No specific treatment should be initiated before the cause is completely evaluated. Ectopic pregnancy is not caused by irregular periods but due to defective tubal function or conception. Usually with Chat Doctor.  If that does not happen, it could mean that the dose is insufficient or the HBO axis has not responded. This needs further investigation. There should be no problem in conceiving if the hormonal imbalance is corrected and with proper monitoring. Good luck."
"I ve had a sore throat for only about 4 days now.. I woke up and hacked up a little mucus in the sink and realized it was bloody. So I took a flashlight and looked at my throat in the mirror. I was pretty shocked actually, to see what looked like a big lump of blood or some sort of sore behind my uvula? I went to my nearest insta-care and they sent me away telling me it was just a virus.. But I ve had strep, negative for TB, and everything s fine but my throat.. Was my health care provider right?","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. By your history and description, in my opinion you are having severe upper respiratory tract infection. The most common cause for this is viral infection. So health care provider is right about viral infection. Viral infection causes severe inflammation of throat. This inflammation causes edema and redness in throat, specifically franc and tonsils. So the swelling you are seeing is edematous tonsils and franc. And this cause coughing and blood in cough due to friction. So better to start treatment for URI, you will be alright in 1 week."

He s got me going to the lab every two to three days.","Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Warfarin is commonly used anticoagulants. 2. However, if it is not helping, you can try newer ones like dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and apixaban.3. They are much costlier and have similar side effects as heparin. You can get prescription from you doctor and get the dose necessary. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again."

I took low cost immune globalin injection(rate rs1200 8ml) around my wound on 13/Feb/2014.But still i m feeling pain around my wound, please suggest me a good hospital in bangalore. i was scared about rabies , please.....","Greetings. Welcome to Chat Doctor. It was a good to hear that you had the important immune globulin which is where crucial to stop rabies in case of being bitten by a rabid dog. This would have neutralized the infection. As far as the vaccine is concerned, you have to have 5 injections in total. A day of delay usually doesn't cause much problem and the time that has passed is a good sign, because the risk of rabies remains for a few days. If there were no problems related to the rabies then you are in the safe zone. And let me tell you here that pain around the wound is not linked to the rabies. It shows either the wound was very deep damaging the muscles, which will take some time to heal, or the wound is infected by some other organisms also. Easily available antibiotic will be enough to take care of this problem. But for that you need to visit your clinician, who will examine the wound and refer to surgeon if the wound required some cleaning. I hope the answer was helpful.

If you do not do this, body finds its own way to throw the waste product out. Body does it through nocturnal emission or through urine. This cannot affect your health. To prevent nocturnal emissions, please start masturbating or indulge in sex twice a week. I also suggest you to consult a psychologist for counseling.

Thanks for your query at Chat Doctor!In my opinion I feel there is nothing to worry. You have contracted viral infection of respiratory tract (It can be Rhinovirus, Influenza, Para influenza, RSV, adenovirus, etc.)The antibiotics will not bring relief but only prevent secondary infections of the tract. So I suggest you continue with treatment. Sometimes antibiotics cause upset of GI tract, so you can take a proton pump inhibitor and anti-spasmodic. Do saline gargles 6-8 times and steam inhalation. You can get few investigations done like blood culture for bacterial infection, gram stain of throat with culture & sensitivity to rule out Group B Streptococcus infection.

"I am taking 2.5 Ramapril, 2.5 Bisoprolol, 10 Prasagrel.  I had a STEMI July 12, got emerg stent in LAD.  Trop was .25 (it was .01 4 days later).  T was inverted until ECG on 09/19/2012 then resolved to normal ECG.  What causes sensation of pounding heartbeat o","Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you some advises. My opinion as cardiologist is that we are dealing with a rhythm issue. You might experience fast heart beats or pounding sensation for different reasons. It may be a simple sinus tachycardia. This mean that your heart beats over 100 beats for minute. Its normal range should be between 60-100 beat for minute in resting situation. It may happen for different reasons from simple emotional stores to different pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. This pounding sensation might happen because of extrasistoles.These is electrical impulses that generates from different parts of the heart different from that of a normal sinus rhythm. This houses an ectopic heart beat that you feel like a skipped beat or as a palpitation Extrasistoles might happen for the same reasons as sinus tachycardia. All sow that might be frequent in ischemic heart disease or in patient after a heart attack because of changes of the heart muscle. In fact, you take medications to prevent this rhythm problems. Bisoprolol is a medication that gets down your heart frequency and extra systolic beats. But if you feel your fast heart beasts and this begins to interfere with your normal daily life it means that the medication might be insufficient. So, Bisoprolol helps you not to feel this heart beats but if you do, it means that you need to do a simple check up to see what's happening with an electrocardiogram and a holder monitoring. After judging the results we might talk for the treatment Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards"
"my husband is diabetic, he has not been well lately. His feet has been very swollen, and he got celulittis on one of his legs. Today when he woke up he had a rash all over his body. He went again to the doctor and the doctor said that he believes it is from his kidney. he put him on predisone 20 mg. 2 times a day. What I want to know is this a prelude to diaylsis. thank you.","Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor. Looking to your husbands' history, I as a nephrologist can understand your concern. In your husbands case, it is necessary to treat cellulitis with antibiotic first. Check basic urine report, S.creatinine and sonography to rule out kidney damage. It is not advisable to take prednisolone when there is active infection (cellulitis) in body. Consult nearby nephrologist with above reports, or you can get back to me also with reports. Swollen feet does not necessarily indicate need for dialysis. So, don't get panic. I think this would be helpful to you. Best wishes. TC. Chat Doctor."
I inhaled a lot of bleach fumes yesterday and I have felt weird since - light headed and not thinking to clear and i want to know if somehow it caused me to have an issue because my partner said that later I lashed out and some some things I wouldn t normally say and apparently it was bad enough to cause us to probably break up and I don t remember the whole incident and I don t want to loose him. That is the only thing we did yesterday that we don t normally do because I am highly allergic to bleach and the ventilation is not that great here. Please Help!!!!,"Hello, welcome to Chat Doctor, Inhalation of bleach will irritate the respiratory tract, and it will make you uncomfortable for breathing. If you have inhaled bleach fumes, you can notice as soon as the fumes enters your nostrils. First thing to do is you have to come out that room to the well ventilated place and try to exile all the fumes which as reached your lungs. It will take some time to exile all the fumes you have inhaled. Most of the time it does not require any treatment, and you will be fine in one or two days. If your symptoms are persisting even after two days you may require a course of antibiotics and oxygen. Thank you."
"I am a 34 year old female. I had sciatica one year back . I was treated with metacoblamin tablets for one month and had injections for one week. This happened in Nov. In April I started to have partial focal seizures. Is the seizures something related to the sciatica pain. I had pain on my left leg but the partial seizures come on my right had, leg and face. I had never had seizures before. My MRI is normal. Please do advice.","What is the cause of sciatica in your cause, is there a disc bulge leading to nerve root compression? I there an MRI spine evidence for it? If yes then focal seizures can be an incidental finding not related to sciatica.  But I doubt if you are having true sciatica as methylcobalamin alone with few injections is not the right treatment for sciatica pain.  Both sciatica like pain and focal seizures can be a symptom of same pathology in brain. Even if MRI is negative you should visit a good neurologist for right opinion and treatment."

Took numerous pregnacy testes and they all came back negative but just September started to feel movements n my lower stomach and took a couple of more pregnancy test and they still came back negative what is wrong?,"Hi there, I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. If you are feeling baby movements and pregnancy tests are negative repeatedly, then please get USG done.

My age is 20.,"The reason behind the recurring blood (folliculitis/furunculosis) may be improper hygiene, excess sweating & diabetes.

Hello doctor! I m 25 years old. recently for the past 2 months i ve been having brown patches over my thighs and waistline which are very very itchy. The spots have now grew darker and bigger in size. Please advise me why this happens? I have been experiencing this after a train travel if I haven t mistaken. Would it be any insect infections like scabies?? Please help me with ur suggestions and what I should do to get rid of it. I also tried an anti fungal/anitbacterial cream called ONABET. Which didn t help in anyway.,"Hi, You seem to have developed fungal infection. Fungal infection is usually itchy. It favors sites like inner thighs, groin and other body folds like maxilla, sub mammary folds etc. as patches and rings with redness, scaling and darkening of skin. Moisture from sweat and warmth of body folds encourages the fungus to grow.  I suggest you to take an oral antifungal like e.g. either Fluconazole or Itraconazole along with the application of a topical antifungal cream e.g. either Fluconazole 1% cream or Terminating 1% cream, twice daily for 2-4 weeks. In addition, I also suggest you to take an oral antihistamine e.g. Tab Cetirizine once a day for symptomatic relief from itching. Hope I have answered your query.

"Hi Dr. I have been trying to have a baby over a year now and failed because of the contraceptives I had taken in the past. I went to a fertility doctor and was prescribed pregnacare for fifteen days and on the fifth day of my next cycle, I had to start taking norlut. Does this drug also help in conception? I just read that it delays the periods and is also used as a contraceptive. am really worried.","Hi, I appreciate your concerns. Which contraception were you using? Demo shot (Demo proverb) causes delay in the return of fertility, but other contraceptives do not affect your fertilityPregnacare contains multivitamins and multimineral supplements. If a woman has deficiency of these vital nutrients it may affect her fertility. So this tablet is prescribed with the presumption that it may improve the chances of pregnancy. It does not have a central role in increasing the chances of pregnancy. Norlut contains a type of progesterone. It is used to regularize or delay your periods. It does not help in conception. What is your BMI?  Are your periods regular? It is important that you and your husband should see gynecologist and do baseline infertility work up (hormone test and fallopian tube patency test for you and semen analysis for your husband). Based on the results of investigations treatment can be planned. Take one tablet of folic acid daily. To increase your chances of conception maintain normal BMI, quit smoking (if you're a smoker) and have intercourse at least three times in a week. If you have any further concerns do contact me through Chat Doctor."

Need your advice","Thanks for the query. From the history provided, your mother is 56 years old, suffering from a low grade fever (around 100 degree F), which occurs mainly at night, along with dizziness and weakness. I would like to ask about the duration of this fever, whether there is any history of weight loss (significant), excessive sweating during the febrile episodes, any history of cough/cold or shortness of breath. I would also like to know whether she has any comorbidities like Diabetes mellitus, any symptoms of urinary tract infection (burning during urination, flank pain, increased frequency of urination etc.) are present or not and whether she has any exposure to tuberculosis. If a patient is suffering from low grade fever which mainly occurs at night, 2 things need to be ruled out Tuberculosis and hematological disorder (specially if history of weight loss is also noted). In this context, I would advise you to get some blood investigations done like complete hologram, Blood sugar, Liver function test and Chest X-ray. You can consult your physician and plan out a course of further investigations and management. In the meantime, Paracetamol may be continued for symptomatic management. Hope this helps you."

The change to generic is a very unlikely source for vomiting. Blood pressure recording should be done routinely and not sporadically. Single measures should not prompt concern. Decisions are best made from an average value from a two-week span. Record your blood pressure on a schedule every day. It should be taken seated after a 10-15 min period of relaxation. Your goal depends on any other problems you may have. In general, it is an average systolic value <150 and diastolic <85. When you meet with your doctor again, bring the record to help determine the need for adjustment."

A bad taste in the mouth can be a result of a wide range of medical conditions and even everyday situations. Many kinds of medications can interfere with the sense of taste and may produce an unpleasant sensation of taste. The feeling of a bad taste in the mouth is usually temporary and improves when the underlying cause is remedied. Dysgeusia is the medical term for an impaired sense of taste. It can result in unpleasant taste sensations ranging from metallic to salty or bitter. The bad taste may also be described as foul or rancid. The severity of the bad taste varies among affected individuals. Dyspepsia can be caused by infections, inflammation, injury, or environmental factors. A history of radiation therapy to the head and neck can also cause a bad taste in the mouth do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care"

"i have asthma and i was having trouble breathing because of some type of infection in my chest.  I cough up brown mucus from my lungs and i know it is some type of infection or virus.  I went to the urgent care and she didnt speak great english not that i care but she prescribed prednisone for my breathing, i dont think she understood the giant infection that i have, i read up on prednisone and i am unsure if thats what i need.  The infection is what is causing my breathing problem.  please help","Hi, You might have asthma with infective bronchitis or pneumonia etc. For infection, you must take antibiotics (quinolones or accolades or cephalosporins) in full 7 days course with analgesic and anti-inflammatories with other supportive treatment to get rid of infection completely. For, asthma you can continue your MDI or rota haler bronchodilators like steroids, beta agonists, anticholinergics with antiallergic Chat Doctor.

"My husband has stage 4 metastatic cancer. 3 tumors on his liver and 2 unknown nodules in his right lung. He has used meth for a long time, shooting it up and smoking it. He was clean for over a year then got his diagnosis in Sept. He is on chemo and is using again. Not all the time. About 4 times I know of. I do not do drugs. How bad is this? I cant pay. Sorry.","Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. I am sorry about your husband and this serious diagnosis. This is terminal stage of malignant disease, and unfortunately it is hard to talk about prognosis. Good news are that he is capable to stand behemoth and this will help him for sure and prolong life expectancy. The most important is his heart and lung function. Cancer usually must grow very much till liver failure occur, so I think that he should continue to fight, and you must give him all possible support to continue with behemoth. Wish you good health."
My right bottom wisdom tooth is trying to erupt the skin but is unable to on its own. I will be getting it surgically removed in a few months. But in the mean time I need to relieve the pain. The tooth gets infected every once in a while and now my right tonsil is swollen and in a lot of pain what can i do? And if I don t take the wisdom tooth out in enough time can it do any damage to it surroundings??,Till you plan surgical removal of your right bottom wisdom tooth you can get that area cleaned by your dentist if you are prolonging than you have to get cleaning done often. Analgesic as prescribed by your dentist should help you to receive pain but restrict frequent use. Warm water with salt gargle regularly and even 4-5times a day will help you to keep your wisdom tooth area and tonsil area received of pain and swelling.
"Hello my husband has glioblastoma grade 4 two year ago we went to the following procedures,surgery of the tumor in the frontal lobe, radiation and temodar for 2months, then 5days cycle monthly also on temodar , six months later he had a progression of the tumor , we stopped temodar and started on avastin every two weeks, he did well until two months ago he had a recurrent again, so we gave him one cycle of avastin and camptozar combination, his motor function is getting worse, what should I expect now?","HI, I can understand how much hardship you are facing this time due to cancer of your husband. I had a patient few months ago with similar kind of complaints. He is a young adult of 35 years, had nuroblastoma in frontal region. In spite of surgical resection and chemotherapy we could not make him alive for more than 6 months. What I mean from this scenario is, nuroblastoma is an aggressive cancer type with high rate of recurrence even after vigorous treatments. Even with good treatment options the life span is less than two years. Then God for giving more years of life to your husband. More the recurrence, less the duration of survival. Regarding the motor dysfunction, frontal lobe is the main motor area of brain. Any persisting disturbance in that area definitely causes worsening of functioning. I suggest you to give enough nutrition and physiotherapy for him. I am really sorry to say that the prognosis of this type of cancer is worse. Anyhow, continue the chemotherapy for better results."
My 80 year old mother was diagnosed w/Parkinsons Disease about 8 years ago. She is having severe problems with coughing up clear phelm in the mornings constantly for about 2 hours. It gags her and she cant even eat breakfast until it stops. This happens every morning and she is worried she will choke on it. She lives alone but has medic alert! Is there anything she can take for the phelm?  She stopped her PD meds due to side effects she was having with them. thank you!,"Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor, firstly I would like to advice you not to stop the Parkinson's disease medication without your doctors' advice. For her present problem, ill advice her to inhale steam for 10 mins 3 times a day. Firstly as soon as she gets up in the morning before eating anything, one time in the day and one time before go to sleep. As soon as her sputum tends to loosen up, cough out as much as possible.Also, she should start doing some breathing exercises-like deep breathing exercises, huffing and coughing, chest expansion exercises. A physiotherapist can help her in all these exercises as well as in chest clearance. If all of this still doesn't help take the help of her exiting medical practitioner who is treating her for Parkinson.  Kindly do not delay a prompt action. I hope this help swish her good health"
"Yes... I had a liver enzyme test on June 14th which indicated: ALP 179 ALT 72 AST 68 then I had another test on August 21st which indicated: ALP 174 ALT 55 AST 56 Apparently my liver enzymes have been high since last year. I have Multiple Sclerosis and have been injecting with copaxone for 15 years. Since copaxone is a man made drug I am under the impression that would not elevate liver enzymes. My MS Neuro does not think my other meds are causing any problems. Two family members (on my mother s side) died from liver cancer . My Aunt was 60 and my Grandfather was 80. This is my question: should I pursue additional testing. Symptoms: dark circles under eyes, rough brown bumby rash on upper legs, veins popping out of my hands, feeling sick to stomach during and after meals, bloated belly and a feeling of something is larger on the right upper chest area. My MS Neuro ordered a ultrasound: Impression: 1) No evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis , 2) there was not pain focal to the gallbladder however pain was noted in the right ribs during exam, 3) technicially difficult exam secondary to bowel gas. A probable hepatic hemangloma and cyst noted on prior CT examinations were not visualized. Was never told about #3.","Hi, Thank you for contacting Chat Doctor. You have elevated liver enzymes, which has been confirmed on two occasions, but as per your description, they have been high for over a year. As you corrected suspected, Copaxone (Latimer acetate) used for treating multiple sclerosis (MS), does not lead to elevated liver enzymes. MS per se is a disease of central nervous system (affecting brain, spinal cord and optic nerves); liver is not affected in MS. In view of a positive family history of liver cancer, you possibly should further pursue the abnormality in liver function tests. However, based on Ultrasound exam, your liver is absolutely normal, and it is a great relief. Best wishes, Chat Doctor."

Also you can have intramuscular demo injection and progesterone implants. All these have its own side effects which include irregular bleeding and amenorrhea.

I went through your history and would like to know more about you like nose symptoms apart from sneezing, eye symptoms, cough/chest symptoms, stomach symptoms, skin allergies, other medical conditions, whether you smoke, your environmental conditions, any medicines, etc. etc. However, at present, from your given history, I would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. I usually suggest my such patients regular montelukast + levocetirizine for 2-4 weeks, depending upon response.2. I would also suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, pollen, molds, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. This will help you identify the substance causing allergies to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.3. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms.4. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes, air pollution and cold air as much as possible.5. Regular breathing exercises might help. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you the best of the health ahead. Thank you & Regards."
I accidentally stuck my finger with a needle I had just used to give my dog fluids this morning as I was trying to take it off the line. It did draw blood and is a small spot. Should I worry about getting anything from my dog. He is getting fluids for kidney disease.,"Hi, happy to help you on your health concern on part of Chat Doctor! In the present case of needle prick injury I would say that yes, you have to take this injury as any other contaminated wound! As per your description, it is more contaminated by the specific fluid you mentioned; there must be some Chat Doctor. .but the amount is negligible therefore not to worry about that. Now you have to think of possible infection and tetanus! Therefore, take antiseptic wash, a toxic and local adhesive for 2/3 days and if this looks unhealthy to you take antibiotics also for 5 - 7 days! Take caution not to get injured again there by rubbing it! Hope you got your answer. Please feel free to write to us if any more queries. Wishing you the best health!"
hi im XXXX im trying to conceive with pcos this month my egg got ruptured on 25th day of my cycle im ovulating by own my doctor have put me in duphaston 10 mg tablet twice a day after food for 10 days can i become pregnant with this one im really confused because im just 20 yrs now married can u pls help me omn this ........,"Hello and welcome to ChatDoctorDuphaston is a progesterone preparation. Progestreone is a naturally occurring female hormone. Its role is to produce secretory change in the endometrium. During the first half of the cycle there is proliferation of the endometrium and during the second half there is secretory change. Secretory change prepares the endometrium for implantation. If pregnancy occurs then progesterone maintains the pregnancy for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks placenta takes over. So, progesterone maintains pregnancy. In the absence of progesterone pregnancy cannot be sustained, and it results in pre-term labor, abortions etc. Progesterone is also indicated in other conditions like irregular menstrual cycle, other menstrual disorders, infertility etc. The role of progesterone is to regularize the cycle in case you have irregular cycles.PCs is another issue. It is due to abnormality of ovulation where the ovum/ egg does not mature. Progesterone is not used for that purpose. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor."

Normally sperm motility should be at least 55 %. Your findings suggest overall 15 % motility, so it is low. You may need proper evaluation for low motility. You may need clinical correlation and investigations. You may need routine hologram, random blood sugar, ultrasound of scrotum, hormone profile, urine RE/ME.

Avoid alcohol and smoking if you take these things. Go for exercise regularly. Other factors like sperm count, liquefaction time and viscosity are normal. If infertility persists then you may need assisted fertilization techniques like GUI etc. Get well soon. Take Care Chat Doctor."

"I am 40 years old women, chronic allergy & Acidity pateint, for last six years. recently  doctors advised to take TIRLOR 10mg tablet, ZANLAN & MYTKEA and also advised to take Vitamin C & E. Before using Tirlor i took past three months PLAQUINAL tablet but no use still allergy is there. doctor advised not to take high protein food, like seafoods, eggs, beef etc. or can foods or preservative items,please advises what to do","Hi. Thank you for writing to Chat Doctor. The medications you are on are anti-allergy medications (Loratadine, Cetirizine and Montelukast). These usually reduce the symptoms of allergy but do not avoid the triggering factor. Therefore, you may feel better with these medications transiently and then your symptoms of allergy may recur if you are still exposed to the allergen (maybe food, dust, perfumes etc.) It is therefore my recommendation that you evaluate yourself for the allergens you are allergic to. Realistically this is impossible and allergy is a lifelong condition, however some tests such as the Skin prick allergy test can help identify from about 200 common allergens. This will help you know exactly what to avoid and maybe pursue a desensitization therapy.Also, there are newer and less sedative anti allergy medications such as fexofenadine that comes in combination with mast cell stabilizers which you can take if the current medications do not help for 3-4 weeks. Hope this helps. Do let me know if you have any further questions."
hi there i have a 6 year old who has had a cold for a week yesterday spiked a temp sleept from 6 till 6 is drinking sort of not really interested in food woke up this morning with pins an needles in just her right hand an it has been contionious all day today can you help in wot i should do,"Thank you for posting your question. The symptoms of cold/low grade fever/decreased appetite that you have mentioned indicate most probably a low grade viral infection. This should take around 5 days to resolve. The pins and needle sensation that you have mentioned are usually due to partial nerve compression. This commonly could occur in cases where the sleep position might cause mild compression of the nerve to the hand. This is likely to be the case. In this case the sensation should resolve is some time and movement of the hand should be easy and not associated with any pain. Also, I suggest that you look for any weakness in the affected limb or increase in/spread of the sensation, in which case a medical consultation would be required. To prevent recurrence ensuring proper sleep position should be enough. Vitamin B (especially containing b12) supplements may be helpful."
"My younger sister has just been diagnosed with Lymphoma and feels that she does not want to have anymore of the Cancer treatments available,bcos she had breast cancer in both breasts twenty two years ago,and has been in total remission for close on eighteen years now,so she knows the rigors of the treatments available.Is there any alternative therapies that can help her through this present condition. There are ten of us girls and all but myself has had breast cancer.We have lost 4 of my older sisters to breast cancer and the rest are all still in Remission,through self treating themselves,the same way our mother,our grand mother, aunts,and grand aunts did,back in the 1935 s up til 2002. Our mother had double breast cancer,when my baby brother was born,she was then aged 49,and he was her 24th child.I am number 19 of those 24 children.Our mother had 3 sets of triples and 2 sets of twins,of which I am of her last set of triplets. However my mother,self-treated herself too after being diagnosed,and she died at the age of 96 yrs. She lived long enough to raise her children,but also to bury 4 daughters,who told her that her methods of treating diseases had gone out with Noah s Arch,and buried 6 sons who died all serving as SAS service men, in the Armed Forces,for NZ,Australia and UK.!!

I can understand your concern. Your sister has lymphoma.  Treatment depends on type and stage of lymphoma.  Overall treatment of choice.  Chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

"Hello doctor, good day, im 25 y/o male, non smoker, occasional alcohol drinker, no asthma. I just got my xray result and it says pulmonary hyperaeration bilateral. Is this result a bad sign? I have cough and tonsillitis 5 days prior to chest xray. thanks.",Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Chest x-ray is just a screening tool for lung diseases. Bilateral pulmonary hyperinflation can be a normal finding if chest x-ray is taken after deep inspiration. So no need to worry about any lung disease or damage by this x-ray finding. Better to get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). If PFT is normal then your lungs are properly functioning. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

There is a sever pain in wisdom teeth...It pains in my head and jaw as well..I have already taken combiflam tablet and it has started its job...but when i try to sleep and lay on my bed again it starts paining...and it does not pain when i am sitting on the chair...How do i sleep with this pain???,"Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Read your query. Yes, the pain in the wisdom tooth can radiate to the head and jaw region. Pain while lying down suggests infection in the tooth. Abscess in that tooth will be the most probable cause. For pain Coquitlam can be continued on full stomach. Antibiotics like amoxicillin WI be required on prescription. Consult your oral surgeon and get a radiograph done, following which you can get the tooth removed. Do salt water gargling. Hope this was useful. Thanks and regards."

hello sir...i want to know how to stop vitiligo from spreading.is there any permanant cure for vitiligo so that i canget rid of this permanantly.l am taking an ayurvedic treatment for this since one year but the results are not satisfying. I am loosing hope. Please help.,"Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Vitiligo is an autoimmune disorder in which our body attacks its own pigment forming cells. If you are having actively spreading vitiligo, we call it unstable disease. You will benefit from taking low dose steroids which are given only on weekends as pulses to minimize the side effects. Many people postpone treatment and resort to alternative herbal remedies because of the fear of side effects of steroids. However, this will lead to rapid spread of the disease, and it will be too late to treat effectively. Low dose steroids given as pulses under supervision can stop the spread of disease and slowly cause repigmentation. There are other modalities like phototherapy, immunomodulator creams like tacrolimus and antioxidants which will also help. Please discuss with your dermatologist about these options. Do not neglect till it is too late. Earlier the treatment, better the results. Do not be frustrated as stress can worsen this disease. Be positive and motivated, and I am sure you will be fine. Wishing you good health,"

hellow dr....i am 19 yrs old and have a habbit of eating multani mitti every day. This habit is from 2-3 years. how to stop craving multani mitti. hemoglobin is also decreased. And also I tired very quickly...i cant understand what to do....plz help me doctor.,"Hello welcome to Chat Doctor pica is a preventable disease so don't worry. It may be due to some nutritional deficiency in the body like zinc or iron etc. It causes anemia and anemia leads to pica. So it is some type of vicious cycle. It may be due to some mental problems personally or in family. If any complication due to pica, should be treated first. After that, psycho social analysis is very important to rule out mental issues. Psycho therapy and behavior therapy with simple medication will help you a lot. For low hemoglobin dietary changes are most important. Take green leafy veg in diet and also veg juices. Use cereals with iron fortified. If you are non veg, eat red meat. Take lemon or orange juice or buttermilk half hour later after lunch and dinner. It will increase your iron absorption and thereby hemoglobin. If severe weakness and anemia. Take daily 1 tablet of iron and folic acid for 3 months. Hope you will be happy with this. Have healthy life ahead.... Take care..."

Stress might precipitate the disease. The disease process may be active in your case which may be responsible for the appearance of new patches.

Intradermal steroid injection may be considered in unresponsive lesions. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  Take care.  Chat Doctor."
"I am 43 years old. 5 10 , 152lb. I did an IVF session, harvesting eggs at age 41. I had four embryos tested using PGD, two were abnormal morula, one normal hatching blastocyst, one no signal blastocyst. I have a healthy 8 month old daughter using the normal blast and am about to have an FET using the blastocyst with no signal . Any idea of the probability of that blasocyst also being normal for someone of my age. I had 10 eggs harvested and in an ultrasound a few days ago, have a good number of follicles for my age, but cannot afford to do a fresh IVF cycle (which is fine)? Thank you. ( Iknow it is likely just a guessing game).","Hello, there are very fewer chances with that saved blastocyst frankly but still worth a try so in case everything goes fine good but in case negative don't get disheartened and rather get a fresh IVF cycle as soon as possible even if loan because after some months you might not be having enough eggs to get a cycle on your bodkin case you have any questions in future you can contact me directly on http://bit.ly/ Chat Doctor."

"I am 83 yr old male, non smoker,non alcoholic,on antihypertensive drug .No diabetes or any heart problem . My blood urea remains high around 60 mg/dl, creatinine is within normal limits. LFT shows SGPT high 117 units , Ggt is also little raised and there is slight increase in phosphorus level also. I do regular walk and exercise everyday and lead an active life.What is the reason for high levels given above","Hi, Thanks for posting your query. Are you an alcoholic ? Do you have yellow discoloration of eyes and urine/ decreased urine output/ decreased appetite/recurrent nausea or vomiting? Gamma GT is very specific to liver and higher values indicates liver pathology. SGPT is also specific to liver, but it has multiple origins. You should consult with internal medicine specialist/ gastroenterologist and should go for thorough check up. You should also go for ultrasound imaging for liver and kidney status. Rise in urea could be due to liver pathology. You should also go for Australia antigen and HCV. You should avoid banana, juices and coconut. Take care,"
"Hi i had the implanon removed 30th of october we are trying to concieve child number 2. I had a weird period about 2 weeks later (started on the 8th of november), like i had it for a day then off for a day then back on, which lasted about 5days. And now today (the 20th) I started bleeding again but it barley noticable, only when i wipe. I am wondering whats going on and if i need to see my doctor? Could i be pregnant?","Hi, Thanks for the query. After removal of implant it may take some time for regularization of the periods. The bleeding you got after 2 weeks could be with Chat Doctor. The spotting now you are having can be ovulatory bleeding. So you better wait for December 8th, if you miss the periods go for pregnancy test once. If the test comes negative this time track the ovulation with kit and plan intercourse around that period. Take care."

At the very first my Triglicirides avule were quite high , my doctor asked me to take Ecosprin-75 and I am still continuting the same. My age os 31yrs. Should I go for a normal delivery or a C- Section ? Which one is good for me and my baby ??","Hi, Neither your age, diabetes, history of missed abortion or high triglycerides make you a candidate for Cesarean. You should definitely try for a normal delivery, and only if some problem arises for the baby or you during labor will the obstetrician be considering a cesarean. Is your diabetes in control, are you taking insulin for the diabetes? If so, when was your last growth scan of baby done, and in what gentile was baby growth. Sometimes with uncontrolled diabetes the baby can put on excess fat around its neck and shoulder area and cause a difficult delivery. These things will be kept in mind by the obstetrician at the time of delivery.Also, if you are on Insulin, it is likely that your Obstetrician will advise Induction of labor at 38 weeks. Hope this helps. Regards."

After 2 months of having these tablets and a good diet you can get your blood profile done again which would see if you have improvement in anemia. Thank you for your query"

"hello. I am a 33 yr old male with chronic neck/jaw pain. i weigh 155 lb and am 58. The Pain has been present going on 4 yrs now and seems to be getting worse..ie ear pressure and constant popping. All this only on Rt side. I have seen dentists, tmj specialist(i wear a mouthgaurd every night), 3 ENTs, and physical therapy and am now seeing a neurologist. I have had 2 CT scans and multiple scopes of neck. All have come back with no result/or answer to explain this pain. My neurologist just had a stellate nerve block performed with little result(did feel a little relief), last week and thinks that i should have another one performed ASAP. stating that the effect is greater the more you have(limit 4)? I guess my question is that i am unable to get over the fear that they are missing something in the CT? is this a possibility? Should i inquire about having an MRI? is there any difference?FYI..I also smoke marijuana before bed--lightly","Hello, You have been very thorough and utilized specialist which would be my first recommendation. I would continue with the treatment recommended by the neurologist that offered relief and hope for benefit with the cumulative effect with multiple treatments. The MRI is utilized in evaluating soft tissue and is a very valuable diagnostic test. Contrast medium can show details on vascular components which may assist your diagnosis. You may have an autoimmune component or have a multiple condition syn Chat Doctor.  I suggest checking on your family history and look for any genetic disorders that could help with diagnosing. You may consider anti-inflammatory medications and muscle relaxers for temporary relief. Ask your doctor for suitable prescriptions. Thank you for your inquiry. I hope my suggestions offer relief and further guidance. I am available to answer additional questions."
I was diagnosed with a B12 deficiency two months ago? I was at 118. Post taking the B12 shots it rose to 879. I stopped taking the shots and was put on one pill (Nurokind Plus) per day. Now I am on 495. Is this the right range since I occasionally get goosebumps/chills in my head. The genesis is head and then moves it across my should body but not to my legs or waist.. Please advise,"Hello, this level of vitamin B12 cannot explain your symptoms. 495 is within normal range which means that other cause have to be sought. Sometimes oral vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed adequately, but this is not usually so with doses that equal to (or exceed) 1000 mg. If the pills you're taking are 1000 mg or more than this is supposed to suffice. Checking your vitamin B12 would be helpful to guide treatment. I hope I've helped!

"I have been dealing with a nice little interplay between pneumonia and asthma for several months now. That finally seems to be getting sorted, but over the last few days I ve developed what I believe is diaphragm pain. The pain is constant, and also sore to palpate. Do I need to do anything about this, or will it resolve with time?","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). As pain can be due to either pneumonia or worsening of asthma. So chest x-ray is needed to rule out lung infection (pneumonia). PFT is needed for the diagnosis of worsening of asthma. You may need antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid. So better to first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."
"I am experiencing diarrhea, vomiting and heartburn when eating vegetables, onions.... Do not have much of an appetite and I am a diabetic so I am experiencing great fluctuation in blood sugar. What could be causing me to have these symptoms? Doctor prescribed Pantotrazole Sodium ER 40mg, 1 tablet per day, for acid reflux.","Welcome! Let's start with making certain the medication is taken properly. Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor and needs to be taken 30-60 minutes before any food is taken. It may decrease absorption of iron, B12, and calcium. Long term use may lead to osteoporosis, so calcium supplementation may be advised. Avoid ginkgo or St. Johns Wort. It may also increase glucose. So, I reviewed these things because if you violate any of the above it may cause a greater fluctuation than Pantoprazole will cause by itself. Source: 2015 Chat Doctor.  Are the vegetables fresh only or certain vegetables only or anything cooked with onions that make you ill? I am wondering about a developing food intolerance or not using a designated vegetable scrubber to get the increasing levels of foodborne bacteria present on our fresh foods. The gold standard for narrowing down this problem is to keep one of those tedious food diaries to tease out the problem. Date, time,food, symptoms for 7 entire days as sometimes it takes up to 3 days for an infection to kick in. Food intolerances are individual, but have seen them change with time. Avoid all sugar substitutes for right now. When you have additional information, please write me again, and we will see if I can suggest some things to stabilize your blood sugars and stop your symptoms. Thank you for your time. Sometimes solving a medical mystery requires more information. Good luck. Kathy Shatter, MS, RDN"

Sorry to hear about your condition. The lactic acidosis you are suffering from is temporary .if your wheezing is controlled then your doctor will shift u from corticosteroid tablets to inhaler steroids which are much safer in long run and will prevent further asthmatic attacks. Try to avoid dusty areas and excessive pollution outside by wearing a face mask. And take plenty of fluids to keep ourself HY Chat Doctor. Ask your doctor to add montelukast+levocetrizine formulation. In long run it will prevent future attacks coupled with fluticasone inhaler. Try to keep your stress levels under control as even emotional instability can trigger an attack.
"Hello, My boyfriend is 37 years old, he has OCD and stammers. He takes rivotril to reduce his anxiety as there is no medication that treats OCD directly. Id like to know if you think his stammering is related to his condition (OCD) and if there is a medicine that can cure it. Also is this hereditery?","Hi, OCD (Obsessive compulsive Disorder) is a condition where a person has repeated thoughts regarding anything and does various acts trying to stop the thoughts, e.g, washing repeatedly in response to thoughts about contamination. OCD is a treatable condition and there are various medication available to treat OCD. In addition, stammering can be related to anxiety. With adequate management, your boyfriend can get rid of his symptoms. There is an amount of genetic component in OCD and anxiety. But that doesn't mean that if a person has OCD, his son/daughter will definitely have it too. It merely increases the chance to develop it. There is no way currently to predict who will develop it and who won't. I would suggest that your boyfriend should seek a psychiatric consultation for initiating proper treatment. Medications like sertraline or fluoxetine are highly effective. Pivotal (clonazepam) will only reduce the anxiety temporarily and long term intake may lead to development of dependence over it. In addition to medication, he can also opt for cognitive behavior therapy consisting of exposure and response prevention. This is another effective means of treating OCD. Hope this information was helpful. Best wishes."

hello doctor thanks for help...... i had a plastic surgery for my scar 7 months ago and my scar is still red is it normal ? and isit true that smoking stop scar from healing or it just delay ....... i didnt stop smoking before or after surgery and if it stops healing would my scar heal if i quit the scar is on my face thanks alot,"Smoking is a well known cause of delayed healing. It generally affects healing in the immediate post-operative period as smoking leads to decreased oxygen supply to the wound by increased carbon dioxide levels and constriction of blood vessels leads to decreased blood supply to the wound. Apart from that various other chemicals in the smoke cause cell damage hence affects healing. Any scar after either operation or trauma takes at least 9 months to one year to completely mature up. In your case the redness of scar after 7 months of operation may be due to many factors, most common of them is that it may be due to scar is still immature and active healing process is still taking place but at abnormally high pace hence it is still red due to increased healing activity. Smoking delays the maturing of scars. Hence I suggest that you should stop smoking, at least till the scar become mature, whitish and fades away. If the scar starts becoming thick and itchy it means abnormal healing is going on and must consult your operating surgeon. Meanwhile, you should massage three to four time per day the scar by cold cream. Chat Doctor."

Is it safe to use covancaine ear drops during pregnancy. It constantly feels like theres a build up of fluid that wont drain.,"Hello, I understand your concern. Cocaine is not the right Chat Doctor.  I recommend you see an ear doctor for a prescription. If you live in a country where you do not need a prescription, you can get a topical antibiotic for ear infection, as well as pain medication. If the pain and fullness in the ear continues, despite the medication, then by all means see a doctor. I hope this helps, Wishing you all the best."
"Hello, I am now 54 and had a stroke at 53 in April this year and heart failure. My heart is now only functioning at 10-15% capacity. I have been assessed for heart replacement but have been told that is not necessary at this stage. Will my symptoms gradually worsen and if so over how long a period. I am now on medication for life. My medication is ramipril, sprionolactone, bisopropol, simvastatin, warfarin and digioxin. Would appreciate any thoughts you may have. Thank you. Mark","Hello. Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Now, the therapy you described you are taking, is crucial in stopping the progression of congestive heart failure and further remodeling of heart chambers. A normal heart pumps 55-70% of its content during one systole. A damaged heart, whatever is the cause, that is pumping 10-15% of its content, means that contains 85-90% of the content after its contraction. This is accompanied with high pressures throughout the body. Any factor that """"helps"""" in raising this pressure, can decompensate your condition and put you in dangerous symptoms, such as salt intake, moderate to vigorous physical activity. Another thing is that a dilated cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart) is prone to dangerous, potentially life-threatening, arrhythmias. At this stage, no matter the life expectancy, I would recommend you to discuss with your regular physician/cardiologist about the possibility of implanting an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to prevent these arrhythmias. I hope I was helpful. Take care."
"My 25 yo son had a wort treated on the bottom of his foot with a yeast injection yesterday. Today he said it still hurts quit a bit it s red & it looks like bit of a red line traveling up his foot. Could this be blood poisoning? He was on his feet for work all day today. Do you think he needs to see a Dr/emergency room right away, or can he keep a close eye on it, and if it gets any worse go to ER? Thanks you!","Hello, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor.

"My hysband takes quite a lot of meds, both OTC and prescription.  Recently he has begun to itch.  He scratches his face, arms, hands, head almosy  constantly.  He also hums constantly, makes facial grimaces and moves his lower leg and foot when sitting.  He has been diagnosed with dementia dCould these nervous movements be caused by medicine side effects?","Thank you for your query. Dementia is a chronic progressive illness, in which a person gradually starts losing his memory (particularly recent memory, that associated with his day-to-day life) along with at least one other higher mental function like judgement/ planning/ executive functions etc. gradually there is change in personality and behavior, with the person becoming incapable of maintaining his activities of daily living by himself in later stages. Popular medications to manage dementia are Donepezil (Acetyl Cholinesterase inhibitors), Meantime (MDA antagonist) etc., given for managing memory and cognitive symptoms. Also sometimes atypical antipsychotics like Quetiapine, Olanzapine, Risperidone etc. are given to manage aggression and behavioral problems. Among these, Donepezil can cause itching. The restlessness (moving head, arms, legs constantly) can be due to a condition called akathisia, caused by mostly antipsychotics. The facial grimaces may be due to a condition called Tardive dyskinetic, another side effect of antipsychotics. The exact cause of the given symptoms, can however, only be clarified after a thorough assessment of the exact medications that he is having, both prescription and OTC, and their duration of use. Also, physical examination is of utmost importance in this case, as observation of the movements in necessary for diagnosis. I would suggest you to consult a Psychiatrist with all your current medications for the same and reduce the OTC medicines as much as possible. Hope I've been able to satisfy your query. Please feel free to contact me for any further clarifications if needed. Best of luck."

I was diagnosed as having a hematoma on my inner left thigh by an orthopedic Dr. The first thing he asked was if I was on blood thinners. At that time I had just gotten off xarelto a couple weeks ago. I had a successful cardio version which allowed me to stop the xarelto after being on It for 2 years. Apparently this hematoma was an after effect of the xarelto. I asked him how long would this conditions last he said probably 11-12 mos. Other than that he said I could wear a compression sleeve. How serious is this? I know at this time there is no antidote for the drug. Is there anything else I can do to help this?,"Hello, I have studied your case and I do not think that hematoma stays for such long time. Most of the time they get absorbed in three weeks to three months. As you are no longer on blood thinner I would suggest you to get ultrasound guided aspiration of the thigh and Chat Doctor.  If there is again recurrence then you need to check your blood investigations. I hope this answer will be helpful for you. Let me know if there is any other followup questions. Thanks"

"Hiiiiiiiii Doctor. I am Sandeep From Jagraon,Punjab (India) I have Fatty liver. I am getting cure from Dr. Ajit Sood from DMCH Ludhiana. I am not feeling good. I am in too much depression. My age is 24. Can u give me some positive point ??","Hi, How are you? My name is Chat Doctor.  I am a Liver and pancreas specialist and I hope to answer your question today. I am so sorry to hear that you are feeling depressed about your condition. But there is no need to be, as it is very easy to treat. Fatty liver can be caused by excessive alcohol intake (Alcoholic SEATO hepatitis, ASH) or due to excessive fatty food intake and sedentary lifestyle (Non-alcoholic SEATO hepatitis, NASH). ASH is usually the beginning stages of alcohol induced liver damage and is completely reversible if the patient refrains from alcohol. NASH is being much more commonly diagnosed currently owing to poor dietary habits and sedentary lifestyles of people. High caloric intake, high fatty food intake and poor exercise regimens lead to deposition of fat goblets in the liver tissue leading to fatty liver (which shows up as increased echo texture on USG). This is also completely reversible in the initial stages if caloric intake is limited and exercise regimens are adhered to. If left unchecked, patients usually become obese, diabetic and in final stages may lead to cirrhosis of the liver which will necessitate a liver transplant. I would suggest a healthy diet and exercise regimen. Although there is no time limit on when to get a repeat scan, I would suggest one, once you have succeeded in losing some weight. Hope this helped and hope you start to feel better. Please do not hesitate to contact me for further details. Have a great day."

"I had blood tests yesterday to see if I can embark on Rebif for MS. My gamma gt score came back at 163 which apparently is high. I am tee total so it s not alcohol related. I take amytriptyline, ramipril , kliofem and have a zoladex implant every three months for PCO disease. Could any of these elevate the reading? I also had my gall bladder removed two years ago. How can I reduce the level?","Hi, Thank you for posting your questions here, I will try to answer them to the best of my abilities. Usually gamma gt is increased in patients with Chat Doctor.  In some cases even patients with hypertension have been known to have high gamma gt levels. While medication has been known to cause an increase in gamma gt levels, I don't believe that the medication you are currently taking has that effect. So what you can do is to talk to your doctor and have him do a liver function test on you, to see whether your liver is functioning properly or not. Once the cause is found and is treated your gamma gt levels should come back down, so talk to your doctor and have your liver checked. I hope this answered your question."

"aboHi, I am 27 years old. I had a vacuum aspiration abortion nine years ago. I was 6-7 week pregnant.Doctors did not prescribe medicine nor antibiotics after abortion.Its been 2 years since im trying to get pregnant , my first hormone test was LH 86.86mlU/ml , FSH 21.77mlU/ml and serum prolactin 22.28ng/ml.Doctor gave me serophene 50 mg because according to my test i was not ovulating.Second hormone test LH 4.42mlU/ml and FSH 7.56mlU/ml. Increase my dose till 150mg of serophene.My last test LH 6.04mlU/ml, FSH 9.93mlU/ml and serum progesterone 58.10ng/dl.Doctors said that i need to do Laparoscopic + Dye.Question:What can be the causes and treatment of anovulatuon and infertility in my case.A few symptoms: pain & dryness during intercourse, painful menses and hot flashes Please give me full details because my laparoscopy surgery is on the 24th of this month.Thanks","Hi, I hope that my answer will be useful to you. First you didn't mention what type of contraception you have been using during the 5 years period since your abortion and the time you decided to get pregnant. Second, I think you have good ovulation because your hormone levels are good except for the serum prolactin. The first thing you must do is to check your partners semen analysis, which is good, I agree to have a laparoscopy as well as a hysteroscopy which is of equal importance and can be done at the same setting. At the end I wish you the best of luck."
"my wife(59years old - Wt. 40 kg ) is having cancer in food pipe and in lungs and she had take 11chemos. Every time when she goes for chemo her hemogram is taken. Today I found her wbc are 3000, that is below slandered .Doctor recommending her Fericip XT(ferrous ascorbate & Folic acid Tab. ) once a day and @B12 (Methylcoblamin +Adenosylcobalamine Cap. 750 mcg + 750mcg) Is it best for her?","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Esophageal cancer with lung spread carries bad prognosis. And anemia is very well known complication of this due to slow, chronic blood loss. So Felicia at containing iron, zinc and folic acid is needed to compensate chronic blood loss. Chemotherapy causes immunosuppression and low WBC count. So multivitamin containing b12 is important in boosting immunity. So continue Felicia at and B 12 as both are correct and needed in your case."

Meningioma tumors were removed .","Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor ! Your husband symptoms seem to be related to acute psychosis. Partial seizures, may trigger this situation. I don't think that these symptoms are related to Retinoid with Chat Doctor.  Considering the fact that he had brain surgery for a tumor, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a brain CT scan and some tests : complete blood count, PCR for infection or inflammation. An EEG may be necessary in case of suspicions of seizures. You should discuss with his doctor on the above issues. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards,"

Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in child Chat Doctor.  For cold, you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do.

"My 37 year old son in law was found passed out and had started turning blue by the time medics got to him and got him awake. He was transported to the hospital where they kept him overnight. Their diagnosis was a possible seizure causing oxygen deprivation. This occurred last Tuesday, 1/30. Tonight while out shopping with his wife he got very confused, told her there were people in the car with them and he s been very tired, falling asleep sitting up. Could this be from the lack of oxygen or something else going on.","I read your question and I understand your concern. Confusion and feeling of passing out can be a seizure manifestation. It is not clear whether he had any tests done after his first seizure (from your description a generalized seizure). Seizures in an adult must be investigated after as usually there is a cause behind them. So apart from some routine blood tests he should have examination with MRI to look for brain lesions (tumor, stroke, infection etc.) and EEG to search for epileptic activity, location and type. Other exams may be needed at times depending on the physical and imaging exams findings. The fact that he's having these episodes reinforces the need for more exams. Treatment will be directed towards the cause and anti-epileptic treatment if necessary. The lack of oxygen described to you has been suggested as a result of the generalized seizure with temporary breathing interruption, as a secondary sign, not as a cause of the seizure. I hope to have been of help."

I got a message from the medical facility saying that my stress test was Abnormal and they want to do an ultrasound. I had a angiogram done about 5 years ago and there was no blockage...can you please tell me what all this means,"Hi, Abnormal nuclear stress test means that there could be a possible underlying blockage in the heart. I can understand that you had done an Angiography 5 years ago which was normal, but 5 yrs is a long time and as the stress test has revealed abnormality you have to get a 2Echo and Angiography done again.

"On Wednesday I had a routine physical and was given the Tetanus Shot on my left arm... today (Friday) I noticed that I have two small red bumps on my arm about a fingertip apart (one of the red bumps is from the injection of the needle).

I have a son who suffers with enursis. We have used the usual methods of the alarm and desmopressin.  It has been suggested to me to look at his diet and foods which he may be intolerant to.  Please could you offer some advice on this and am I able to get any food allergy tests carried out anywhere. Thankyou,Hi.... I have just gone through your query. There is no evidence in medical literature that enuresis is related to food allergy. Any specific food will not induce enuresis in an otherwise normal kid. I do not think for this reason you need to take up a food allergy panel testing. You are already on treatment for enuresis for which you can continue the same. I again reiterate the fact that enuresis is not related to food allergy. Regards -
"Hello Dr. Grief, I may have an imbalance issue or perhaps vertigo. problem directs itself to my ears which when checked last couple of days appears to have no wax or infections. do feel like the room turns sometimes, and have checked my blood pressure - all normal. but do have a low blood sugar and have to eat frequent small portions hope you can provide some guidance here?","Hi, Thanks for writing in. Low blood sugar means the amount of sugar level in your blood is below normal. The brain and other organs in the body require sugar for metabolism and proper functioning. If the sugar levels go below normal then there is compromise in the functioning of the organs. The brain consumes a good amount of sugars in blood as its requirement. If it does not get this nutrient then there will be delay or sluggish functioning in the brain. This is known as hypoglycemia. When the brain function is below normal at that time a person starts getting warning signals in the form of dizziness and vertigo."

MY TMT TEST REPORTS  WAS POSITIVE BUT THELIUM STRESS TEST REPORT  NORMAL IN 2009 . AGAIN IN FEB 2011 I HAVE BEEN REPORTED FOR TNMT AS POSITIVE .DURING WHOLE TMT TEST NO SIGN OF ANY CHEST PAIN WAS FETLT BY ME BUT AT TIMES I FEEL HARD BREATHS BUT AFTER PASS OF GAS THINGS BECOME EASY .KINDLY ADVISE ME FURTHER COURSE OF ACTION.,"HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor. A treadmill test is used to predict whether there are blockages in the heart arteries. Many patients have a positive TMT with no symptoms. Hence, they require further evaluation. Many of these patients who have no symptoms with a positive TMT do have underlying blockages in the heart. Some percentage of these are false positive. A thallium stress test is a more sensitive and reliable test than a TMT. So this implies that in your case TMT is false positive. So in future the TMT will always be positive and hence it is of no insignificance in false positive cases like u. For routine check up for heart blockages in your case a stress echo or dobutamine stress echo, or a thallium stress test should be done rather than a plain TMT. At this point of time you need not worry about positive MTS since they are going to persist. You have to do one of the above tests mentioned. Wishing you good healthRegards."

what is panderm plus cream?does it clear the black marks on face?,"Hi, Panderm plus cream contains ofloxacin, ornidazole(antibacterials), terminating(antifungal) and clobetasol(very potent steroid). As you can see, it's basically a multiple combination cream containing antibacterial, antifungal and steroid to control inflammation. These multiple combination creams have very few specific indications but are misused very commonly as over the counter treatment for fungal, bacterial infections, acne and pigmentation. These creams would harm more than benefitting in any of the conditions mentioned above. These should never be used to clear pigmentation or acne over the face. Take care. Chat Doctor."

"I recently lost my boyfriend, age 47, to what autopsy revealed as cardiac tamponade, serious sudden attack/death.

Since then, I found from his coworkers that he would have episodes of severe stomachache / severe heartburn and he would eat an apple and say it was gone for now?  He was on Prilosec for the heartburn, however, I do not know if he followed up with a regular physician or not?

I recently had elevated liver results and so they tested for Hepitis and that was normal... EKG also adnormal and said something about doing a 24 hr holter monitor . This is the third time both test were abnormal and my regular doctor always stops after doing the same test. I m 32 5 3 215lbs. I have had normous health issues throughout life. I had Hasimotos and thyroid was removed but those test were normal. Just wondering what should I do to get past the routine of doing the same test and getting no answers.,"Hello, First there are many causes of elevated liver enzymes. I suppose you were tested for one of the most common ones which are the viral hepatitis (Hepatitis B and hepatitis C). The fact that you had Hashimoto thyroiditis, which is an autoimmune disease (where your body attacks itself), is a risk factor for having concurrent Autoimmune Hepatitis. This can be tested by blood tests (ANA, AMA, ASIA, etc.), but may require a liver biopsy. Other causes considering: alcohol intake, iron overload, medication induced hepatitis, fatty liver (common in diabetics, overweight people). If no answer is obtained with lab work and ultrasound of the liver then I would recommend you going for the liver biopsy."

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and I think you are having both allergic rhinitis and asthma. I would like to make following suggestions for you:1. To reduce episodes of wheezing/asthma symptoms, it is important to control allergic rhinitis (nasal symptoms) as well. Control of nasal symptoms will improve control of asthma. So I would suggest taking daily montelukast and levocetirizine for at least 6-8 weeks. This will help both nasal symptoms and asthma symptoms.2. Aeroflot is a controller medication for asthma. Please make sure that you are using it regularly on daily basis. Also, please make sure your technique of using rota haler is absolutely perfect. If the technique is not proper, the Chat Doctor. 3. Please use reliever rota cap inhalers like albuterol or levosalbutamol if you are having wheezing in spite of this. If you need to use them for more than twice a week, I would suggest you to upgrade dose of controller medications after consulting your doctor.4. I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible. Please do not smoke if you are smoking.5. I would also suggest you regular breathing exercises and a nutritive diet rich in vitamins & minerals and anti-oxidants which will help you in a long run.6. Personally I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will advise you allergy testing. This will help you to identify the substances causing trouble to you as well as ways to avoid them. Also, the Allergist may suggest you allergen immunotherapy which may work on your immune system to improve allergy symptoms. Hope this will be helpful to you. Wish you the best of the health.

"I feel like I am going to slip on the bare floors but not on the carpet but if I remove my shoes or sandals , I can walk bare foot without the feeling of slipping. I have added plavix and metformin to my medicines recently and wonder if they are causing the problem?","Hello, What appears to me is the slipping is not caused due to the medications you are taking. This slipping might be due to non-gripping of the foot skin texture.  What I would suggest is to dip the feet in the normal room temperature water and then clean it nicely with a towel, so the dead skin comes out by rubbing the towel harder. The new skin texture will form, and you will get a good grip. Also, try picking up petals or marbles with the help of the toes, so you start getting good holding grip.

Doctor has always advices Azibact and Ascoril ls was concerned how many times to repeat the same prescription is ok with her and there is no improvement in her health at all every 15 to 20 days i have to see a doctor please advice me,"A child who is given antibiotics very will often need them more and more as they suppress the bodies natural immunity. Both you and the doctor are jointly responsible for this situation. You are responsible because worry about your child makes you seek the doctor every so often. The doctor is responsible because he cannot withstand your pressurizing him to prescribe strong Chat Doctor.  Be aware of this trap. As you said, you are also using Astoria in addition to the antibiotic. Why Astoria? Does she have more than a simple cough and cold? Is there fast breathing? Phlegm (productive cough)?

You should go back to the doctor and request him to do tests on your daughter to understand the problem better. They should consider referring you to a senior pediatrician, a pediatric chest physician or an allergologist. I hope this helps."

My younger brother is suffering from anemia and shortness of breath in connection with kidney disease...EPO shots not working. Next step? 52-year old male on kidney transplant list for last two years. Fistula surgery done twice. Lungs and heart clear but severe water retention in abdomen and legs.,"Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Kidney diseases cause refractory anemia. Since patient is in waiting list for kidney transplant, he is probably having end stage kidney disease. He is also not responding to EPO (erythropoietin) Injection. So blood transfusion I can understand only option left for him. He may need 1-2 PCV (packed cell volume) units every 10-15 days. This will take care of anemia. His breathlessness is due to fluid retention. And in end stage kidney diseases, dialysis is the only option to prevent fluid retention and relieve breathlessness. So he may need regular hemodialysis 1-2 times per week for fluid retention. Try for early renal transplant, till that time regular blood transfusion and hemodialysis will take care of anemia and breathlessness. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your younger brother. Thanks."

"Two nights ago I woke up due to a very strong pain in my right side below my belly button and to the right of the pubic area.  During the course of the day this pain shifted to low down on my back on same side.  By the evening the pain had returned to the front but was severe enough for me to call 111 and ask their opinion.  Two options suggested, first to go in to see the out of hours doctor then or wait and see if got worse.  I chose the latter but by 4 a.m.  the pain was very bad.  I again rang 111 and was told to go to the local out of hours service tosee a Doctor. This I did and the GP examined me and said that I had blood in my urine so her diagnosis was renal colic and renal stones.  She also mentioned possible infection.  She rang Casualty and I was sent there.  During the morning I was given strong painkiller rectally which greatly helped.  CT scan of my kidneys was normal as was two subsequent urine tests.  The consultant told me that I had probably had a stone which I passed.  Yesterday evening at home the pain in my back had gone but I still had a niggly discomfort in my flank.  This morning the pain in my flank has returned and Iam unsure where to go from here.  I did a urine sample which on looking at it is slightly dark but I cannot see any blood in it.  I would be grateful for your advice as towhat I should do from here if anything.","Hello! Thank you for the query. Your symptoms indicate kidney stones indeed. Lower right area is where ureter is located. So a stone in the ureter which has stuck there will give symptoms like yours. Please note that the stone which you have probably passed does not have to be the only one. Small stones can also be passing right now, so you have less intense pain. Dark urine can be caused by low liquids' intake. If there is no intense bleeding in the urinary tract, you won't be able to see any blood in your urine. Urinalysis can do that. I suggest you to follow this steps:- increase mineral water intake (even 3 liters/24 hours)- start cranberries supplementation- increase physical activity (like running or jumping) so the stones can get out - in case of pain, hot bath or Buscolisine can be helpful this won't help, you should consult your doctor again, have urinalysis, blood work, abdominal ultrasound and consult urologist.

"hi my 8 year old daughter is going in for rabies vaccine tomorrow. She was bitten by a dog 7 days ago and I did not instantly see the bite mark. When I did discover she was bitten I put neosporin on the bite mark and bandaged her up..soon after I brought her to her pediatrician. Her pediatrician asked I wash the wound instantly and put her on antibiotics for two days. She said nothing about getting her a rabies vaccine. I called the health and mental hygiene department where I was told to take her in right away for rabies vaccine, actually that there is a 10 day period where she needs to get the vaccine. I m wondering if all this is correct and if it will be extremely painful. Whether or not I m still taking her in. Thanks.","Hi, Was it a stray dog or domestic one? If domestic, is it vaccinated? If not vaccinated, or if it is a stray dog, we have to start vaccine without further delay. No need to worry about 10 days delay-rabies has a comparatively longer incubation period of 1-3 months, so even now, vaccine might be effective. The vaccine is only as painful as it is for other vaccines. Nowadays, most centers give intradermal one, which is less painful than intramuscular ones. If the dog is available for observation, and has been asymptomatic throughout the 10 days period, chance of rabies is extremely rare, but stick on to the advice from authorities. Take care.

Swelling in the legs and feet can come from many causes, one of them being general circulation or ineffectiveness of the kidneys to rid the body of excess water. Most times, people with lower extremity swelling will be placed on diuretics (""""water pills"""") to see if that helps reduce the swelling. If the veins are not working as properly as they were, there may be a need for compression stockings, assuming the arteries are normal. It would be good to get the situation evaluated being that there are so many causes. I hope this answers your question, if you have any further questions, I am here to help. Thanks."

I see that you are under treatment for schizophrenia. Even then there is minimum possibility of lack of ejaculation. Retrograde ejaculation, as its name implies, is a condition where the seminal fluid is ejaculated backward (retrograde) into the urinary bladder instead of forward. This usually occurs because the neck of the urinary bladder, which normally closes to block such retrograde flow, is unable to do so. Such inability usually results from neurological or physical damage to the bladder neck, which in turn can result from a variety of clinical conditions. I suggest you to consult a urologist for further investigation and advise. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR.

"My girlfriend has mrsa, and even when it gets under control, she is highly susceptible to contracting it again and getting a bad outbreak. I work in a gym and carry it easily. I am trying to find a detox or cleanse that I can do to prevent myself from infecting her over and over.","Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor. D Mangukiya answering your concern. MRSA has tendency to spread easily in crowded area and also in hospital environment and also in community Most important way to prevent outbreak is wash your hands with soap and water or when you wash dishes. Rinsing is an important part of the cleaning process. Use these products for routine cleaning of surfaces. Sanitizers are used to reduce germs from surfaces but not totally get rid of them. Sanitizers reduce the germs from surfaces to levels that are considered safeDisinfectants are chemical products that destroy or inactivate germs and prevent them from growing of Mupirocin ointment is a effective way to eradicate the MRSA infections. If repeatedly infection occur, then u have to do MRSA surveillance in people in your gym by taking nasal and axillary swab samples because some people also carrying the MRSA and act as carriersPlease make surveillance and after that use mupirocin ointment and frequent hand hygiene and also cleaning of instrument after use is only solution for you. I will be happy to answer your further concern. Thank you,"

Your description is highly suggestive of HERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease). Since your food pipe is located automatically in the mid of the chest, this reflux causes chest pain. You were rightly prescribed omeprazole.  Do avoid spicy food, caffeine. Have your head end elevated with two pillows while sleeping. Have your dinner 2 hours before bedtime.

"Hello My Dad has been suffering from bleeding in the roof of his mouth sporadically for 5 days now. To give you a background he has had bowel cancer , which has been treated and appears fine now. He also had blood poisoning for 2 months over Christmas and was in intensive care. He has given up smoking now, but he was a smoker for a long time. He also drinks (cider mainly and daily). He is 64 years old. Can you give advice on how to stop the bleeding? I am worried that this is mouth cancer. Thanks Lauren","Hi Lauren, More than mouth cancer, I would attribute it to the minor esophageal varietal tear that could have possibly occurred. To stop the bleeding, we need to find the cause of it. If it is due to esophageal tear, then the bleeding veins are to be ligated surgically. If it is a primary bleed from the mouth, it may be due to authors ulcer in view of his general condition. In that case, multivitamin supplements will help him. Pressure compresses can be used locally to arrest the fresh bleeding. If it is due to mouth cancer, then again, management will be surgical. These are only my broad views. A physical examination would be ideal to know the cause. Hope this helps."

"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...  Im 47/ female - In Fall 2010 my blood test came back slightly low blood platelet count.  I stopped taking vitamin c and a month later the count was fine.  A few weeks ago my tsh was slightly elevated.  Any connection between the two? - my mom has hashimotos thyroid problems.","Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. No, There is no connection between low platelet count and elevated TSH.2. If the platelet count is above one lakh, not to worry. 3. TSH if elevated, needs correlation with thyroid hormone levels, and if its reduced, you will need thyroxine therapy. A thyroid autoantibody and FNAC study is necessary for evaluation of Hashimoto thyroiditis. Elevated TSH is one of the earlier symptoms of it.4. Taking It B12 supplements, will be helpful for low platelet count. . Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again."

Im a 16 rising senior in highschool, and im considering going back on concerta for my ADHD. however, I ve been generally concerned with the side effects of the medication, specifically how it effects blood flow in the body. As an athlete, restricted blood flow can be a significant impairment, one that could cause me to pass out or become dizzy (only what ive read, im not prone to these symptoms otherwise).

It's difficult to predict before taking the medicines. But whatever it may cause, affecting your athletic performance because of blood pressure changes is unusually rare.  Chat Doctor.

"Hello Doctor, I am 31 yrs old male and weigh 200 lbs. I am having cough since three months. Intially my physician thought it was bronchitis and gave me amoxycillin and it was not completely gone after 1 month it was still there and she gave me zithromax and that didnt help either. lat month I got my xray done and its all clear. I am having hypothyroid which is in control and also high blood pressure and am using lisinopril 5 mg. I notice that there is some kind of itching in the throat that is causing the cough and also whenever i cough I get a clear mucus. I never had fever in the last 6 months atleast.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). As diagnosis of bronchitis is not possible without PFT. Obstructive pattern on PFT is needed to diagnose bronchitis. And treatment of bronchitis is inhaled bronchodilators.  You had not given any inhaled bronchodilators in the past, so your bronchitis is not fully recovered. So I advise you to consult pulmonologist and diagnose yourself first. You may need inhaled bronchodilators."

It is not a cause of concern. It occurs due to rapid transit of the fecal matter through the large intestines and so the bile pigments do not get the time to get converted to the yellow pigment of stool.

Just continue breastfeeding as usual.

"Hi doctor, when I was about 6 I was diagnosed with mild asthma. I only had symptoms during cold season, and then it eventually went away all together. I am now 18, and during the past year I have been getting chest tightness, low peak flow readings, and wheezing. Some doctors say my lungs are clear and its not asthma, and others say it is? What should I do. I am on advair, spiriva, and ventolin. Please help","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of asthma is more likely. Asthma can recur or reappear in adult life. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose asthma, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You may need newer ultra long acting bronchodilators like indacaterol and glycopyronium. Chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercises are also useful. Oral combination of antihistamine (levocetrizine or fexofenadine) and anti-allergic (montelukast) once a day at night is also beneficial in asthma patients.Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

I have a 8month old baby. I went to the doctors with him yesterday and they prescribed Ibuprofen 100 MG/5 ML & ACETAMINOPHEN 160 MG/5 ML ELX. Is it safe for me to give him this? They used to give me infant tylenol. I just want to make sure its safe to give him the prescribed about which is 1 teaspoon as needed.,"Hello, I can understand your concern. Child Chat Doctor.  The adult doses for Ibuprofen is 400 to 600 mg 2-3 times a day while the dose of Acetaminophen for adults is 500 mg up to 3 times a day. Infant Tylenol is Acetaminophen suspension only. However, as the child ages, his weight increases and thus for adequate effects of the medicines, dose has to be increased. 100 mg/5 ml for Ibuprofen and 160 mg/5 ml for Acetaminophen is not that high dose that can cause any side effects of overdose to your child. So you can give these medicines to him for relief. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. I wish your son feels better soon. Best,"

my blood pressure raised very high after one night binge cocktail alcohol. Does the pressure effect is permanent? Or it has normalized now and I can take normal diet. My blood pressure normalized automatically after 03 days and now I am feeling better.,"Hello..... When we consume alcohol, it affects out body in different manners according to dose and time. During beginning, Our sympathetic system becomes active after consuming alcohol that can cause Tachycardia, flushing of face, palpitation, high blood pressure, euphoria and sexual excitement.

So according to your description, that was perfectly normal physiological phenomena. So do not bother regarding that. But my personal advise is Please consume alcohol within a limit and do not consume alcohol daily. Thank You."
"Hi.. I have a sebasceous cyst on my forehead that I am most likely going to remove. It is not (at this time) inflamed.. Its just a bump with no redness at all. My primary physician gave me a script to see a plastic surgeon (considering its on my face), however, Im wondering if I should see a dermatologist first. My concern is, that although a plastic surgeon is good at surgery...are they competent to treat a cyst on a face...Any thoughts??","Hi, Thanks for posting in Chat Doctor. Well, sebaceous cyst on forehead needs removal, as if it gets infected, then it may cause disfigurement. What your primary physician has advised is right. You need to visit Plastic Surgeon for its removal. That is because, it needs excision, which is a surgical procedure, to be done under local anesthesia under aseptic precautions. Also, Plastic surgeon will perform the operation in such a way that there would be minimal scar after removal, considering cosmetic reasons. Hope the information provided would be useful for you."

"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here... Hi, i have a question, I was just release from the hospital with a blood clot. It was located on my right leg in the upper thigh part. I had to take a long trip and while on my trip my right upper butt has knot and is warm to touch and hurts very badly.

My lungs still feel inflamed- family history of GERD but have no overt symptoms of acid reflux, no family history of anxiety. I was hoping to get some feedback thanks.","Hi, Welcome to the forum. It is nice to know that your investigations have a normal report. The symptoms of Asthma can be controlled and discomforts reduced, but there is no clear-cut cure of the ailment. It is important for you to take care of your lifestyle, quit any kind of addition as it may trigger your symptoms. Stay stress-free and have a good sleep.  It is caused by allergy of any kind, cold, pollen, food, etc. Some have a history of asthma as a family ailment. The people who are psychologically sensitive are affected by it. Asthma is a medical condition that results due to the inflammation, swelling or narrowing of the airways (bronchioles) in the lungs. It may cause over-production of mucus sometimes. IIT results in shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing.

"Hi. My girlfriend recently got her belly button pierced and now has a small rash which hadnt appeared until a few days after it was done. Its not itchy she says, but it is sore all around her belly button, not sure if this is just a result of having it done and part of the healing process or if she is elergic to either the metal or possibly the savlon she is using to clean it? Any help would be much appreciated Thanks AAAA","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor An allergy to metal will manifest as itching. The rash you mentioned is sore. So it could be an infection or irritant contact dermatitis to salon. Without an opportunity to closely examine the lesion, I would not be able to accurately specify the condition. You might need to consider a consultation with dermatologist for assessment and work up. Infection will require a course of antibiotics and anti-biotic cream. It is better to stop cleaning with salon. Just use warm salt water instead. Hope this helpedTake care"

"My husband has gleo blastoma brain cancer...been under treatment for over 1 year following surg.  5 days ago had """"bubble"""" to come up in his vision that has been coming and going.  CT scan showed nothing,,,eye exam....nothing.  Will go to Neurologist this week...do you have any answers?","Hi, Thanks for writing in. Sorry to hear the progress of disease in your husband. In my experience with patients of GBM I and II have a higher survival than those with GBM III and IV. It is important to know the size, location and if there is any pressure effect due to the tumor. Most tumors cause brain pressure, swelling or edema due to slightly increased electrical activity in the surrounding brain. The bubble in his vision might be due to pressure on the optic pathway. This has to be carefully evaluated by doing a CT scan or MRI scan since the clinical exam is normal. This can be controlled by giving steroids and mannitol. The real problem is any change in appearance of the tumor and its pressure effect on adjacent structures. Cancer is a difficult condition to treat, and every tumor behaves differently. However, we must fight cancer till the end. Praying for a quick recovery for your husband"

"hi, my daughter is 7yrs, has been prescribed with beclometasone 100gms  from the age of 3yrs, with one shot in morning and evening.And salbutamol sos, its been a yr she is not used salbutamol. Do you think by any chance she can cut down her beclometasone or can she stop it eventually??. her GP says it might grow out with her age. Do you reckon it? What can u suggest, i really want to stop it, as its a steriod and it might have a long run effect on her liver.","By """"shot"""" did you mean an injection or an inhaler? If it is inhaler that you are talking about, then, first, beclomethasone is not appropriate for a child. It may be better to give fluticasone or budesonide inhalers. Secondly, if she has been without a single episode of breathing difficulty since a year, sure, why not first cut out the night dose and continue with once a day 100 micrograms for a month or so, and then kill the morning dose as well. If, however, cutting down the morning dose causes any recurrence of her wheezing or asthma, you should be visiting a specialist urgently to take guidance. Hope she is well soon."
"I just got back rom the e.r yesterday because for about the past week now I have been having severe pain on my right abdominal (side stitch feeling) and back. At first I thought I had appendicitis because the symptons I had were similar. It hurts to take a deep breathe and the pain is unreal. It feels better sitting down hunched over. The doctor gave me an ultrasound, and an xray which botChatDoctore out normal. So he did some bloodwork and that came back positive. I was then given a catscan but that was normal. The hospital discharged me with some narcos and motrin, which neither of them seem to help. The pain is agonizing. What could possibly wrong?","Hi. Sorry to know that you have not been diagnosed and your visit to ER went fruitless. The history you have given is very catchy.... It hurts to take a deep breath = and feels better on sitting down hunched over. The cause of pain in your right abdomen and back together can be due to an inflammation of the retroperitoneal structure like the kidneys, pancreas and so on. I would advise you the CT scan of the abdomen. Normal X-ray and ultrasonography have their limitations in finding out many problems hence the need for a CT scan. You have not mentioned the positive blood reports. Get serum amylase and lipase too done. If the pain is agonizing I would suggest you to visit ER again and get further tests done. A proper treatment depends upon the correct diagnosis."

In most cases, the main reason for crying during passing motion is due to hard stools. Since, in case of your child hard stools are not present we have to look for other causes of crying during passing motions. In case of infective stools, the stools become acidic and as a result when the child passes motion it causes burning sensation due to which child cries during passing motion. In worm infestation there can be pain while passing motions. Kindly do stool for routine microscopy test and stool culture test. Give more Fluids to child. Give soft diet to child. Review with reports. Are re-examination with doctor should be done so that we may not miss any important finding. An ultrasound abdomen is also recommended. Take care."

"Hi, I am 40 years old 175lb, 5-7 and have hepatitis B, my new girlfriend is planing to go and get shots for her protection, she was told it will be 3 shots one month apart for each. Do we have to wait for all 3 shots / 3 months or is it safe after first or second.. I do not want her to get infected and am willing to wait but just want to make sure. Thanks in advance","Hello, How are you? Thanks for writing into Chat Doctor. My name is Chat Doctor.  I am a liver and pancreas surgeon and I hope to answer your question today. I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis, and I am happy to hear that your girlfriend is planning on getting vaccinated. The reason why booster shots are given during vaccination is to create a subset of immune cells called """"memory B cells"""". These cells store the memory of the antigen (in this case hepatitis B virus) and will produce protective antibodies as soon as they encounter it the next time (for ex if your girlfriend by any chance gets infected). The creation of memory b cells may require multiple exposures to the antigen - hence the booster doses. Having said that, this holds true to the majority of cases. Some people can develop high levels of protective antibodies even with minute exposure to antigens. The only way to know for sure whether a protective level of antibodies have been attained is to measure the Anti-bug antibody levels (which is done routinely in most laboratories). Some people who are poor responders may need up to 5-6 booster shots before a protective level is reached. So in short, if you want to be sure of the immunity of your girlfriend, I would measure her blood levels of protective antibodies (>10 IU is considered protective). This does not mean I am discouraging you from getting the booster doses - The only way to be fully immune is to complete the vaccination schedule. Hope this helped and hope you get better. Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further details. Have a great day"
My sister in law burned her brain on drugs as a young woman the doctor had a name for it im trying to explain the term to a social security worker. she has been on ssi disability for years then one day decided to contact ss on her own we are trying to undo the damage/,"Good Afternoon, I'm sorry to hear of you and your sisters difficulties. This must be a very hard experience to have and go through. Unfortunately brain damage is very difficult if not often times impossible to reverse. Nonetheless, there are options to seek improvement. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and comprehensive brain injury rehabilitation services can be utilized to help increase the activity and function of your sisters brain; and as a result, this therapy may recruit more areas of the brain which are active to take over the portions of the brain which have been damaged beyond repair. In some cases with this therapy, some portions of the brain-damaged, but still with adequate blood flow and or some semblance of remaining function can be brought back to higher if not near-normal to normal function. Nonetheless, there are no medications or surgeries which can reverse portions of the brain with definitive damage. If your sister experiences symptoms that result from this brain damage (pain, loss of function, spasms, seizures, neurological changes), there are of course medications and targeted therapies which can be used to help; but the damage itself, as stated above, is more difficult to treat, and I recommend seeking the above listed therapies. I wish you and your sister the warmest and happiest of holidays; and trust even with such difficulties, that there will be happiness and things that can give you comfort and enjoyment. Family, friends, conversation and of course therapy will all in my professional experience lead you in the right direction. I hope my experiences and advise matches well to your personal case; and will lead you in the correct direction. If not, I, and other physicians are always available for further discussion."

"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...my mother is of 71 year aged suffering with intestine cancer from last 1.5 year doc says that she is not in such position to operate and face keemotherepy now she is facing the problem in urine also although we are giving her treatment of ramdev please suggest?","Hi, Thanks for writing in. Cancer is a challenging condition and every patient is given a customized treatment keeping in mind the staging and expected response to treatment. As your mother has been suffering from intestinal cancer for last 1.5 years therefore it might be in stage 3 or 4 cancer. In such a condition it is difficult to treat by surgery alone and often even if surgery is done then chemotherapy and radiation therapy are important. It is possible that surgery might have certain limitation due to age and local spread of disease. In this situation it is best to start chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and then give radiation to further limit the disease process. Please discuss in detail with the oncologist. Holistic medicine might keep her mind at peace but does not effectively treat the cancer and its spread. You must improve her general condition by giving nutrition. Please do not worry."

The best way to prevent allergic rhinitis is to prevent exposure to allergen after finding it. Otherwise, medications like antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers help a lot with least/no long term effects. So, you need not worry. You can promote her to go for yoga and respiratory exercises. All the best. For rest please consult your doctor only."

I have pain while active and while at rest. Should I have it removed or is there potentially something wrong with it?","Hi. Thanks for asking in Chat Doctor. Mirena contains Levonorgestrel, a progesterone that is released slowly, daily for a period of five years. One of the main problems of IUD like IRENA is interred menstrual bleeding in the initial 3 to 6 months. Progesterone results in spotting, vaginal discharge, abdominal pain. Mood changes and bloating sensation. But these symptoms wane off after few months as the body gets adopted to the effects of progesterone and the hormonal imbalance due to IRENA.Funds can result in vaginal infection or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) which will also present with similar symptoms of pain, discharge and spotting.

"i been feeling very depressed lately and i dont know why everything in life is pretty decent i have a girlfriend who loves me and i love her but i feel like sometimes i just need room for myself and everything i do is kinda revolved around her, is this causing my depression im not sure it just constantly recurring. i also recently went on a hair drug called minoxidil its a topical treatment and my depression started around this time, could this be the cause?",Hi. I understand your concern. Minoxidil doses not associated with depression or it won't cause depression. Low mood/loss if interest/ sleep problem/ Fluctuation in mood etc. may indicate depression. Proper psychological and thought assessment will give better idea and diagnosis. It can be treated witChatDoctorbination of antidepressant medicines like SSRI and anxiolytic. Choice of medicines depend upon diagnosis. Psychotherapy and counseling can help. Glad to help you further. Thank you.
hi my 11 year old is suffering from asthema and a constant allergic cough which has been diagnosed as sysptom of respiratory obstruction. he was on a regime of Levolin and budecort. but now the doctor has put him on Foracort. it dosent seem to be helping much. should I switch back,"Hi I have read your question and understand your concerns. Thank you for posting in Chat Doctor. Levolin contains albuterol that is short-acting bronchodilator but has rapid mechanism of action, while Decor contains budesonide that is a steroid. Your doctor has put him on Forecourt that contains Budesonide and Forometrol (that is a long acting bronchodilator). So instead of using two inhalers, a patient can use single one that comes in combination. If Forecourt doesn't help much you can use Leveling and Decor. I suggest my patients Tablet Montelukast (chewable) 5 mg at nighttime as well. Wish your kid good health."
hi! i am 23 yrs old and i am trying to get pregnant from past 2 yrs. my husband is 30 yrs old. i have pcod. doctor suggested iui. but iui was done 24 hrs after ChatDoctor ingection was given. scanning report showed that it was not ruptured. was iui done too earlly.? is there any chance of me getting pregnant by this first attempt of iui. ?,"Hi, I think GUI was done at correct time. Rupturing of follicles may take 34 to 36 hours after the injection.  So, you can do a scan after2 days. If not ruptured, you can take Chat Doctor shot again and repeat GUI. Discuss with your doctor regarding this.  The chance to get pregnant in one cycle of GUI is 10 to 15 percent.  So, you can get pregnant this cycle also. But if it doesn't work, then you can try GUI for 3 to 6 cycles.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor."
"Hi, I am 44 years old lady. My reports show 60 SGOT and 67 SGPT. Earlier it was higher and I took Udiliv 300 for 3-4 months. It came to around 40. I have the problem of high bleeding and clotting.  The doctor had to do premenstrual D/C but they deferred it saying that I have to lower the SGOT,SGPT levels. Is it possible or should I consult any other doctor?","Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. These are mildly elevated liver enzymes and don't indicate serious liver damage so i don't think this can cause looting abnormalities. Its elevation is common found in many disorders must most usually is alcoholic, viral, autoimmune or toxic liver damage. The most common liver disorders are fatty liver which can be found in healthy people, but usually is resulting from elevated blood lipids, overweight and elevated blood sugar. If ultrasounds didn't find anything and viral markers are negative then you have no reason to be concerned. You should treat it by changing dietary and lifestyle habits. Do exercise, avoid alcohol, smoking, fats, fast food and carbonated Chat Doctor.  Eat more fruit and vegetables, boiled meat and follow some of hepatoprotective diets. Findings usually improves on such measures. If not, then some medicines can be prescribed. You don't have to lower Sports, you have to treat prothrombin time and clotting abnormalities if there is some. Wish you good health."
"I was diagnosed july 2013 and had surgery, chemo and brachytherapy for uterine cancer which was clear cell and adenocarcinoma. Treatment was complete on Nov 19, 2013. yesterday had some spotting and wondered how worried should I be. Went in to doctor and had pap, and CA125. I was diagnosed at stage Ia.",Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. But vaginal spotting can be the early symptom of local recurrence. You had completed your chemotherapy since November 2013. So not on any treatment for 12 months. This duration is sufficient to produce recurrence at local site. So wait for CA125 and PAP smear result. You may need CT abdomen and PET scan to rule out local recurrence.
"Wow that was quick. I was just diagnosed with cirrhosis 2 months ago. I am 43 yrs old. In 2000, I had Gastric Bypass surgery (successfully)however, addiction changed then to alcohol. I am anemic and have had 2 blood transfusions in 2 years. I also have hepatitis which I also just found out. ? is I drank 60 days straight/drunk. This Jan. and Feb. and I bloated up like the Michelin man, I knew something was really wrong. When I went to the doctor in early March I weighed 292/bloating so severe, I now way 207 I m 5-7 and I m scared I wont be able to stop losing. I am on 2 20mg of furosemide and a potassium and I get b12 shots due to malnutrition. I am freezing all the time, my fingers are always cold is this from the cirrhosis. My doc wants me to go to a liver specialist, but I don t want to hear my death sentence. Thank you for your time.","Well, I am a gastrohepatologist, but I won't give you a death but a live sentence. Quit Chat Doctor.  Its more important than any of your medications at equal value with liver transplant we say. I know is a difficult decision, but you should take it for your good and live. As for the weft loosing a part is caused by diuretics I think, loosing liquids with urine you loose ascites and so you lose weight."
"Hi Doc, I am having severe cold for more than eight days. my nose is running and cough is stuck in the chest and also sour throat. I took Nuhist tablet for three days, 3 tabs per day and Roxithromycin, 2 tabs per day for four days and also Ambrolite-s cough cyrup for the same time.  But I didnt get positive result. The pharmacist changed it to CEFTAS CV 200 and Omnacortil-20 and Ambrolite Levo cough cyrup. Is is the right combination for my cure. Regards, Dinesh","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. No, this is not right combination of Chat Doctor.  You have given omnacortil, which is oral steroid. And oral steroids are not indicated in cold. So better not to take omnacortil. Absolute syrup is having bucolic, expectorant. So it will worsen your coughing. So better not to take this. You should start antihistamines and anti-inflammatory"
"..my 12 year old boy is having what he calls hot flushes, he has been diagnosed with lyme disease. Is this a reaction to the antibiotics?? could it be something called herxing?","Hello have gone through your question and understand your concern. Let me enlighten you in brief about Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction or what is commonly called as Herding. It is basically an unavoidable reaction or immune response of body caused when treatment for disease is initiated due to death of disease causing pathogen not by antibiotics. Positively Herding shows effective antibiotic therapy and is seen as evidence of continuing elimination of these very persistent bacteria. The above mention symptoms of hot flashes are suggestive of Herding but the symptoms of Herding vary person to person, if symptoms worsen contact the treating doctor. Thank you."
Hi I have been on petogen for a year now after giving birth in march 2013. My last injection was scheduled for 07-05-2014 and i did not go. I have then had unprotected sex. Could i be pregnant? or is the contraceptive still in my system? How long will it stay in my system before i can fall preggies again? Best regards Lee,"Hi Lee, How are you doing ? Petogen is a depot preparation, which is taken for duration as 1 yr may stay for 4-6 myths after stopping. But a better way to know if the hormone levels are normal is, if you get periods the hormones are normal. But this is not definitive, you can get pregnant even before you have periods. But after 3-4 myths of last injection the chances of pregnancy gradually increases & by 6 myths the hormone is mostly gone. Hope I have clarified your queries, do write back if anymore queries the best Chat Doctor."

Do you have a tip how to eradicate the redness/ inflammation on her face. I already give her hydrocortisone 1% + physiogel cream for the last 14 days. (before that, her pediatrician give her advantan ointment + kamilosan cream). thanks before","Hi, As per your query you have symptoms of redness and inflammation on the face of the baby which seems to be a type of allergic reaction known as urticaria. It could be due to vitamin deficiency as well. Need not worry. I would suggest you use a moderately potent topical steroid such as fluticasone, twice daily over the whole affected area and use it for 5-7 days. Wash the area with plain water and apply ice pressure on it. Visit dermatologist once and get it examined to find out the exact cause of lesion and start treatment accordingly.  Chat Doctor.

I have a friend who shoots up opiates on occasion. He did it yesterday and today he has a very hard and painful bulge on his arm near the injection site but not at the injection site. He didn t miss the vein. So he is wondering what this bulging knot could be? And what he can do to make it go away?,"Hello, I have studied his case and I think that he may have developed thrombophlebitis of the veins. This is causing pain and feeling of knot. I would recommend you to apply hot water fomentation. Also, oral antibiotics are needed. Thrombocyte ointment should be applied. I hope this knot will resolve soon. If it increases in size than he needs to show it to surgeon. I hope this answer will be useful for you. Let me know if there is any other followup questions. Thanks"
I have an 20 month old granddaughter who walks very stiff legged -- especially in the mornings. Her dr. has put her on liquid naproxen which doesn t seem to help a lot -- it does somewhat but not a lot. Can children this age have rheumatoid arthritis?,"Although juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is possible, it is not necessarily the case here. There can be a number of causes of stiff ruggedness in a child, and it needs to be examined by an orthopedic doctor or a pediatrician before further comments can be made. It could also be that the child is walking like this to deal with some other problem which is being overlooked. Naproxen was for pain and would not tame care of the cause."
R/dr I was suffering from the VDRL positive and the same was treated by the doctor.the doctor checkde the VDRL report and sidt to me the infection was minor position.The doctor gave me the penciling injection the same was well at that time.After long period it is again make trouble for me i got wound on my penis due to that. I am very upset what i should do to cure my self from the disease.I am unmarried now and soon gonna to marry.kindly guide me it is curable or not in the Indian medical science. Thanks dev raj punjab,"HelloThanks for your query, based on the facts that you have posted it appears that you have V Chat Doctor. This is most likely to be due to incomplete treatment with penicillin. One needs to take Long acting Penicillin (Endure LA) twice a week for 3-4 months to eradicate infection completely. Please get swab tests of fluid from ulcer done to rule out any other form of STD like Chlamydia, Herpes etc."
60yo male history of atrial fib with 2 strokes from them does not take his medications..now sleeping more than half the day..falling down at times no slurring of words but seems to be getting much weaker has severe cramping in legs and chest at times...is this from the atrial fib and what can i do for him ..he was in hospital last year for 1 week to get his blood thinned out took the meds for 1 month then quit hasnt been back to dr since,"Hello Thanks for posting at Chat Doctor. Atrial fibrillation means irregular contractions of the heart. Due to irregular contractions of the heart, clots tend to form in the heart which may later go towards the brain and other organs leading to stroke. Hence, such patients are kept on blood thinners which prevent the clots from forming. These clots when they migrate to the brain can cause falls. Also since the heart rate is irregular, the heart may not receive blood supply for short intervals which can also lead to falls. As you said he has stopped hid blood thinner medications, this may be due to formation of clots. Cramping in the legs is less likely due to clots or blood thinners, but some heart patients are on diuretic medications like lasix which can cause electrolyte imbalance and result in cramps. Kidney problems can also lead to electrolyte imbalance and cramps. Calcium deficiency, It D deficiency are also important causes of cramps. Please do an ECG, serum electrolyte levels, serum calcium, It D add 2 D Echo. Brain imaging (MRI + MRA) and carotid (neck artery) Doppler should also be done to rule out narrowing of the vessels of the neck and the head which may cause falls. Wishing you good healthRegards"
"Hello, I banged my shin very hard on a metal bar about 5 weeks ago. There is still some swelling. About 1/8 - 1/4 of an inch larger than the other shin. A small red spot on the impact area. Been icing and taking baby Bayer. It will go down, but through out the day, it worsens. Is this normal?","Hello, As what I see with the history is there will be some hairline fracture or muscle rupture due to direct impact over the shin. Shin is a very sensitive area with very thin muscles, or I would say the fascia more which doesn't safeguard the tibia like how other muscles help for other regions. I would advise you to take up an x-ray as it will definitely help us to understand if there is any hairline fracture. Because fracture in lower limbs shouldn't be ignored by any or all means as they are weight-bearing joints Meantime till you meet up an orthopedist, you can do hot water fomentation and rest the limb over a pillow.

In 2006 I was diagnosed with slight de-generitve arthritis on my c-5 & c-6. cervical. Due to allergeric conditions I stopped taking Celebrex about 2 months ago, and it is about the time this pain started.","Hello, Thank you for contacting me at """"Ask a Doctor"""". I will try to answer your question to the best of my ability. It sounds as though you have some mild degenerative disease in the cervical spine.  This would account for your symptoms.  Degenerative disease can cause pain, numbness, stiffness, and sometimes pain down into the neck, shoulder and arm. If you have any a lot of pain I would suggest taking something simple such as Tylenol.  Sometimes seeing a physical therapist can help with these issues, and they will teach you some stretches and exercises to perform at home.  If the symptoms do not improve with these measures, then I would think about seeing your primary care physician. I hope this information is useful for you. Please do not hesitate to message us back if you have any further questions. Best wishes, A Chat Doctor."

"For over a month I have been consistently dizzy, lightheaded, weak, shaky, and extremely fatigued. And when I say consistently, I mean EVERY day from 10amish to 7pmish. It almost feels like a blood sugar issue, like I haven t eaten in a long time, but even when I do eat, it doesn t help at all. I had blood work done last week and everything was normal. These symptoms all started two weeks after I had the Implanon birth control implant put in. I am EXTREMELY frustrated because I feel horrible EVERY day and it makes getting work done much, much harder than it needs to be. What are the chances that it is the Implanon causing this?","Dizziness or fatigue can occur with the use of implant and the symptoms may reduce in the subsequent cycles.

"Hi Doctor, My son (5 and 1/2 years old) has severe cough and cold. He had wheezing sound as well  while breathing. The Doctor prescribed him Deriphyllin syrup  (5ml morning and night), Anti-biotic Azhithromycin ( 5 ml 3 doses) and Corico-CS (cough syrup). Is taking Deriphyllin syrup safe for kids?",Hi. I do not recommend Deriphyllin for a kid of this age. There are better alternatives like Albuterol or Levosalbutamol and in the form of metered dose inhalers. Inhalers are the newest management strategies for this. If I were your pediatrician I would have suggested the use of Decor metered dose inhaler (100mcg) 2 puffs twice a day through a spacer and this is for regular use for 8 weeks. Another metered dose inhaler is Leveling and this can use as rescue therapy whenever the kid is having severe cough in spite of regular usage of Decor. The technique is very important and very crucial for the Chat Doctor.  Regularity of medicine usage also matters a lot. So do not discontinue abruptly after you notice some improvement. The technique of administering an inhaler using a spacer has to be taught to you by your doctor and these are prescription medicines. So I suggest you consult your pediatrician for this. Regards -

A thorough neuromuscular and musculoskeletal assessment is advised. As for TKR - physical therapy is advised to strengthen the muscles of the knee and get the good strength and ROM. For Neck and back problems an MRI will be performed and post which the soft tissues will be assessed and also the clinical assessment. Medications on a longer run can provide possible damage to the kidneys and physicians might not like to take a risk. Also, with physical therapy - which is totally non-invasive with no side effects shall be tried. As research supports, that with physical therapy, disc degenerative cases, TAR, back and neck pain shall be treated with the majority of improvements.Also, for strength improvement, there is totally a need of exercises and good food.

Thank you","Hello there, Thanks for writing your query, Bleeding gums NAD nausea are the signs of gingival inflammation known as gingivitis. It is caused due poor oral hygiene, improper brushing and flossing that leads to accumulation of bacterial plaque and calculus deep in the gum pockets and root surfaces of the teeth.  Gingivitis presents with symptoms of redness, bleeding gums, swelling, pain, recession and sensitivity. It needs to be treated by thorough professional deep scaling of gums and root planing of the teeth to remove all the irritants, this will help in resolving the symptoms followed by a course of antibiotic and analgesics.  I would suggest you to go for symptomatic treatment at home like gargling with lukewarm saline water or antiseptic mouthwash like chlorhexidine or Betadine.  For chest pain and bridges over the body you need to consult a physician and get examination done. I hope this helps, take care."

This seems to be a viral illness - all this is usual. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 3-4 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. The red flags when you need to take her to an emergency are - loss of consciousness/ seizures/ green colored vomiting/ blood in the stools/ low urine output/ excessive lethargy/ breathlessness.

"My Father has fungal  infection  in left  leg  ,  we  have  consulted many  doctors  in  bhubaneswar .  due  to  infection  the skin  turns black and  thick . He is being  treated  for more  than 5 yrs .  Can  u suggest some  surgery so  that  the  skin  will  be  normal .","HiT hank you for asking ChatDoctorI have gone through your query. A culture of skin scrapping should be done to rule out the causative agent/fungus. In case of suspicion of lichen plans a punched biopsy also should be done. A consultation with a dermatologist will be helpful to diagnose the condition properly and to treat it. If it is fungal infection then topical antifungal agents along with oral tablets of antifungals like terminating or fluconazole will be needed for long term to eradicate the infection. In case of lichen plans, moderately potent topical steroids will be helpful also. Hope this may help you. Let me know if anything is not clear. Thanks."
"Good evening! I have a hard growth at the left base of my neck (the back). It doesnt hurt at all, but it bothers me everytime I see it. I did some work with a cargo company for four years at JFK Airport where I have handled radioactive materials and other infectious stuff. There was even a white powder spill (hazmat) in our warehouse once around 2003, and I know that I have breathed that stuff for a good while before we became aware of its presence on the floor of our location. Could this be a benign tumor or a cancer in the making? Whats worse, I dont have insurance now.","Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have enlarged lymph node.  It can be due to reactive hyperplasia, tuberculosis or lymphoma.  Or you may have some soft tissue tumor like lipoma or neurofibroma or other mass.

"Hi, I was on Loette Birth Control pills but stopped taking it for a month. I started taking Loette again about a week ago but not during the start of my period . If I have unprotected sex, will I get pregnant? Or how long do I have to wait before I can have unprotected sex?","Hi tan, Thanks for consulting us. Ideally Letter pills should start on day 1 of a women natural menstrual cycle (i.e. the 1st day of menstrual bleeding). Starting on days 2-7 of the menstrual cycle (e.g., Sunday start) is allowed, however, a non-hormonal back-up method of birth control (e.g., condoms, spermicide) is recommended during the first 7 days of Letter use. After that you may resume unprotected sex without facing extra risk. I hope you know that pills do not protect against Sexually Transmitted Diseases & it is a good practice to add a back-up method like condom for protection.  Wish you good health."

Thank you for the query. Jaundice is not a disease but the symptom. To make it disappear the cause needs to be removed. So it is advisable to have some diagnostics and find the cause of jaundice.

Jaundice can be caused by many diseases like bile ducts blockage by stones, liver cirrhosis, liver viral infection, blood disorders with hemolysis, pancreas cancer, liver cancer and many more. So it is advisable to have abdominal ultrasound, liver tests (AST, ALT,GTP), pancreas enzymes (amylase), HCV and HBV antibodies, urinalysis. Abdominal CT might be necessary if no finding in ultrasound. Hope this will help. Regards."

"Hi my son has cough variant asthma, he is on a controller med of symbicort and recently was given duoneb in instead of albuterol for a flair up he had that was not improving after oral steroids. He again has began having a more wet cough and instead of starting albuterol, i started duoneb treatments one to two times a day as needed, they seem to be working much better than the straight albuterol, but i was wondering if duoneb is only supposed to be used when his flair up is more severe or if it is okay to start initially.

I have had chest pain in my left upper quadrant ever since. My doctor said it s anxiety and heartburn. It s a dull to deep pain. Any ideas?","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you are having anxiety related symptoms mostly. But better to rule out cardiac cause first. Because of two reasons.1. Left sided pain.2. You had QT prolongation in the past. So get done ECG and 2D Echo to rule out cardiac cause. If both are normal than no need to worry about cardiac cause. Your symptoms are mostly related to anxiety only. And anxiety itself can cause heart burn (acid reflux) so anxiety appears more in your case. Consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions, try to identify stressor in your life and work out its solution. Avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright."

He is on neoproxin can he take his nor on also","Hi and. Your question is unique and requires a unique treatment. Treatment programs for individuals with fibromyalgia have been diverse and varied, and as yet no one single treatment has worked for every patient. Some patients have reported partial symptom relief with tricyclic Chat Doctor.  Treatment through active stretching, postural education, body mechanics, and other forms of therapy has also provided some benefits. Specifically, it has become apparent that persons with fibromyalgia benefit from aerobic conditioning and other exercise programs. According to standards for fitness developed by the American Heart Association for a normal population, showed that 80% of patients with fibromyalgia are physically unfit. For your brother it is important to start with simple, painless exercises, initially, by a method called Feldenkrais method. In Feldenkrais method individuals perform small, gentle movement patterns, usually in a group setting, in response to verbal or written cues. The movements are self-directed and performed within each person's comfort range. Mental imagery of the movements is encouraged if the movements are perceived by the patient or the instructor to be too difficult. Mental imagery is also occasionally used as part of the lesson for all participants. Mental imagery has been widely studied and documented for its positive effects on learning. Also, the individual is guided hands-on by a Feldenkrais practitioner, who may be a physical therapist, through gentle and slow movements. I hope this information is helpful to you.

"my husband was just prescribed Prednisone, 60mg, once daily for 3 days to help fight the fatigue he is experiencing.  He is a 3 year Stage IV Lung Cancer survivor, and we are not sure if the fatigue is from the cancer, the Xalkori, the recent whole brain radiation, or just because he hasnt been active in a few months.  How will the prednisone help the fatigue?","Hi, Prednisone is a corticosteroid Chat Doctor.  It is converted into prednisolone in our body by the livers specific enzymes; thus, it can be active. Usually, corticosteroids mimic the cortisol, the natural corticosteroid produced in our body. Therefore, prednisone has many effects in our body. In cases of cancer (as your husband), prednisone is used to lower the bodies immune response and as a potent inflammation reducer. In regard to being fatigued, all the factors you mentioned (Xatori, brain radiation, being inactive for months) and especially cancer (with cancerous cells taking all the nutrients to your husband), all of them make him fell fatigued. To suppress his immune system (which is currently fighting against cancer with the help of Xatori and radiation), your doctors have prescribed prednisone. Hope it helped!

"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? Please type your query here...My husband had a stent put in on July 9th 2010, 2 weeks to the day later, he started having ulcers in his mouth, I mean serious ulcers, at one point he could not even swallow his own syliva. He has been in the hospital twice with this, they have tested him for about everything. Every time he get s off steroids, these sores come back, he s lost about 42 lbs. Could he be allergic to the stent??? All the doctors tell me it has nothing to do with the stent??? Something has to be causing it.","Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The severe ulcerations over the mucosal surfaces of the mouth can be a recurrent authors dermatitis. Usually it occurs following, stress, trauma or surgery. The other cause can be an allergic origin resulting in allergic dermatitis or licensed reaction. Based on your description of the lesion, it is difficult to come to a clear diagnosis. So consult an oral physician and get it evaluated. If I am your treating doctor, I would have suggested you to take topical anesthetic and analgesic like 2% lidocaine, apply 3-4 times daily before food and topical steroid like triamcinolone acetone 0.1% 4-5times daily after food. Do saline gargling. If the lesion does not heal in 5-7 days then consult an oral physician and get it examined. I hope my answer will help you, take care."

"Hi, My husband was diagnosed last week with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. 3 days after the diagnosis he was told he has six months to live. (FYI he is only 49 years old....) It has been a roller-coaster of emotions for both of us, which social workers discussing """"quality vs quantity"""" of life, arranging for a hospital bed to be delivered to our house, etc. Two days after being released from the hospital (where they had moved him to the palliative care unit - not a good sign.....) he was given a schedule for chemo and radiation treatments. We attended a chemo class yesterday and found out his schedule calls for doctor visits 2 and 3 times a week, as well as a five-week period where he will go everyday (M-F) for radiation treatments. Now we are both confused. When we heard the six month diagnosis we were planning on how this time would be spent (trips to the beach, fishing, etc) but now with the treatments scheduled, we are thinking that perhaps the six month diagnosis has changed - is there still hope for survival??? is what we keep playing out in our heads, thinking surely the doctors would not prescribe these intensive treatments if he was surely going to die by January??? Family members, friends, and, of course, my dear sweet husband and I are holding on to any glimmer of hope there may be....but we want to be realistic. Why would a doctor tell him he has six months to live.....and then prescribe tons of chemo and radiation???","Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Because, chemo and radio is necessary to achieve even those 6 months. I understand your concerns, but pancreatic cancer is one of the most dangerous and has very poor prognosis. Radioth and chemo is the last option for palliative treatment, and it can only slightly prolong lifetime. So many patients even decide not to treat it if they consider that 3 or 4 more months are not worth of fighting. This is up to you. In both cases' prognosis is poor, and he is not able to live for 1 year. But as I said if he wants these 6 months he needs therapy. If not, he can hope for 2-3 month of life. Hope I have answered your query."

Also i have a tooth that suddenly started hurting. I have made a dentintal appointment.  The tooth is a root canal.  Also ate some potato salad yesterday that might have been too old.  It tasted ok but was left over from Labor Day dinner","Hello and welcome. Thanks for sharing your concern. According to the history given by you, I would like to suggest you few things. Nausea, dizziness and stomach pain could be due to stomach infection due to consumption of stale food products. Toothache is probably due decay. To confirm the diagnosis an x-ray is required. Coming to intake of painkillers for arthritis, I would say please see your physician for correct dosage, as too much of any medication can lead to adverse effects on your vital organs like kidney, brain and heart. Thus avoid self-medication please. Finally I would like to say visit your dentist first, get the tooth examined. Your dentist might prescribe you antibiotics and necessary analgesics for three days. This will take care of other symptoms too. If you donor feel better even after taking prescribed medication then you can see your gastroenterologist for further help. Hope it helps. Thanks.

My sperm count at the moment is about 31million, is it possible my wife wil get pregnant very soon. she has been diagnosed and she is ok medically just that they gave her clomid to induce ovulation .","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, I am Chat Doctor For pregnancy you do not need too much sperm count. Along with sperm count, most important is sperm motility and sperm morphology. According to WHO 1999, requirement of sperm count is >20 millions / ml, requirement of sperm motility is >50%, and minimum 60% sperms should be of normal morphology.  To fertilize an ovum, a sperm has to go up to the fallopian tube. If motility is lower than required, then the sperms are unable to fertilize an ovum in spite of having normal sperm count.  So, for pregnancy you need 50% sperm motility and 60% normal sperm.  From the above discussion it is clear that no definite comment can be done regarding pregnancy on the basis of only 31 million sperm."

Taking syrups for too long will make the baby addicted to this. You could try to make some finger food and let the baby to self feed.

Another way is to take the baby with you in the kitchen and try to cook together. This way he will be more motivated to eat."

Hi .. My husband is having pain in his knee. We consulted a doctor. He told us that the pain is due to gap in knee bones. Due to lessening of bone due to internal tensions between bones.

Take physiotherapy to restore the range of motion. Do massage with oil over knee joint. Use knee brace. If he is over weight then should walk with stick. You can take steroid injections. Take medicines like ibuprofen or naproxen but not for long use. If he is unable to walk for even 40 steps get knee replace. If he doesn't get relief than consult the or tho."
"hello doctor, my name is usman and i think so i am suffering from cystic fibrosis. i am experiencing breathing problem by birth as bronchitis. but from past year i am totally reliable on sabutamol inhalers. i am also experiencing transpaent thick cough whicChatDoctores almost every minute. i have also digestion problem.Please suggest me some good treatment.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Albuterol is short-acting beta 2 agonists (SAGA). It is not for regular maintenance treatment. And this is the reason why your bronchitis is not controlled. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will definitely improve with long acting inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Indigestion should also be treated simultaneously. So take pantoprazole and levosulperide combination on empty stomach. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."
"I had some pain in my back molar a few weeks ago. I was told I had an infection and was given a course of antibiotics and told at some point I would need a root canal or an extraction.Fast forward to five days ago, my tooth was hurting at night and I was told that the nerve was dying and would need the root canal or extraction. I chose to just take it out.  The Extraction was quick and easy and the Dentist said it should be fine. However, now five days there is slight discomfort where the tooth has been pulled. The tooth in front is quite sensitive and my jaw and cheek slightly aches. It is not horrendous pain at all, but more a dull ache. I am worried something could be wrong. On top of that I feel a little like I have the flu.

I have a couple of problems.  For the last 3 weeks my family doctor has been treating me for bronchitis.  I went to a pulmonary specialist this past Friday and found I have been having asthma attacks.  I am now on a nebulizer every 4 hours.   The wheezing is driving me crazy.  I also have had a musty smell in my nose for the past year or so.....Help...I am going crazy,"Hello, Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. Forum. I would come up with these measures for asthmatic patient, these are.1 Avoidance of mite, dust, hay, pollen, sudden fall & rise of temperature , fine dusting powder, mold, fine cotton fibers will help in an asthmatic patient .2 Nebulizer helps but temporarily, so in my opinion consult one more specialist and get his opinion. As in this type of patient I, usually prescribe antihistamine + bronchodilator .3 Musty smell is actually due to allergy to certain allergens, which are responsible for asthma. In my opinion consult a pulmonologist and get his opinion (2nd). Good luck."
"Does we have antidose for Steroid.actually ,my wife taken some ayurvedic/traditional drugs for cure of Asthma,after two months she found her total body getting swelling,so discontinued the medicine.upon enquiry the person whod given those medicine admitted to used some steroids.though for Asthma she take the help of inhaler and under control but,her body is in swelling condition for last one month and feels severe pen while walking.plz advise the remedy.","Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your wives history and would like to make suggestions for her as follows:1. Side effects of steroids are more common if they are taken orally or injections. I would first think that she has had side effects due to oral steroids which were mixed in medicine. Common side effects of oral steroids are weight gain, diabetes, high blood pressure, gastritis, and many others...2. Many of the inhalers for asthma also contain steroids, but they are in inhaled form, and they are minimally absorbed in blood. Hence, they usually do not cause such side effects. Hence, they are much safer for long term use as compared to oral steroids.3. As she has already had side effects, unfortunately there is no antidote. Side effects of oral steroids can decrease with time (a few months) after discontinuation. Though she will be able to use inhalers as per her doctors' advice.4. For better asthma management, I would suggest her to consult a pulmonologist or allergy-asthma specialist who will assess her symptoms in detail and will prescribe necessary treatment.5. I would also suggest her regular yoga & Panama, regular exercise like walking which increases immunity and lung capacity over long time.6. I would also suggest her a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals which will gradually improve her immunity over long time.7. Regarding pain while walking, it could be due to overweight, but it is important to know exactly which part of leg is aching to guide further. An orthopedic consultation may be helpful if pain is severe/of long duration. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to her. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish her the best of the health ahead. Thank you & Regards."

Other cause may be infection of the middle ear, may happen at that time.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Thank you."
"Sir, I am from Berhampur Odisha. I have been suffering from breathing difficulties since 3 months. I have difficulties in taking breah. I have tested the blood, urine, BP, thyroid  etc and everything came normal. Here the chest specialist has also conducted  the spirometry test which was normal. My p-flow is 400. My nose is always congested and when I use Nasivion spray I feel relief in my nose and my breathing difficultiy vanishes. One should not use a nasal spray for a long time but I am bound to use that one since the Inhaler prescribed by the chest specialist does not help me. Kindly help me.                                                                                                                       P,/y                                                                                                                          Odisha","Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. It is good that your spirometry is normal, I assume it was done with a """"post-bronchodilator study"""". In that case, I would think your cause of feeling breathing difficulties may be nose obstruction.2. I would agree that decongestant sprays (which """"open"""" a congested nose) should not be used for long time, they can cause rebound symptoms upon discontinuation.3. Were I treating you, I would prescribe you intranasal corticosteroids (mometasone or fluticasone) for at least 14 days. I would also prescribe you montelukast and levocetirizine for 28 days.4. I would suggest you to use an inhaler like albuterol for breathing difficulty symptoms on as-and-when-needed basis only.5. Allergy testing for common air-borne allergens like house dust mites, indoor molds, regional pollen, insect proteins and pet dancers (if you have pet) will be useful to identify the substances causing allergies to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which gradually improves allergy symptoms by working on immune system.6. Regular breathing exercises, physical activity and a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals will also help you in a long run by improving your lung capacity and immunity respectively.7. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you the best of the health ahead. Thank you & Regards."
"my aunt is on valaprin 200, she has developed sever swelling in both her legs, she has been keeping her legs elevated , but its not showing any improvement, besides she is also having psoriasis on the legs, the redness of which has reduced but swelling and pain persists. Please advice","Hello, As she has swelling of the lower limbs and even though keeping elevated it's not helping I will advise doing passive lower limb range of motion exercises, use lower limb stocking, monitor the water intake and output, and active ankle toe movements as well.  Valarie 200 is a medicine for other issues and not for reducing the swelling. I think she should take a diuretic for reducing the swelling.  Also looks like she has a reduced venous return and needs to have a cardiac assessment on a safer side. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Jay In Chat Doctor."
my co sis has taken tab.divery for getting her menses which she had not got since 2 months....her pregnancy test was negative n on intake of divery tab for 5 days she got her menses but the flow is not like usual menses.... is it normal or any problem ?,"Hello, I have gone through your query and here is my advice. As per your history you have taken tab diver only once, so it is safe to get menses through these tablets. As no medicine is completely safe, and if you have any side effects then immediately consult your gynecologist. Watch for symptoms like dizziness, excessive bleeding, abdominal pain. Till then keep your self HY Chat Doctor.  Hope I have answered your query, let me know if I can assist you further."
"I have been on cipro for 3 days for inflamation in my bladder. The perscription is over today and although there is no burning or bleeding like there was to begin with, I feel the urge to urinate all the time and feel I need to be on medication longer.","Yes, your concern is very true. In my hospital, I usually prescribe Cipro minimum for 5 days. Actually choice of antibiotic & duration of the course depends on severity of infection judged by parameters like presence or absence of fever, diabetic or not, complete blood count, number of pus cells in urine etc. Please give me your details as per above-mentioned parameters, so that I can advise u further accordingly.

"Hi, I am 50 years old, 6 foot tall and weigh 94kg. I am on heart medication as I had a heart attack 6 years ago. I am also on thyroxine for an underactive thyroid. My recent semen analysis shows a motile sperm count of 1.9 million. This is based on: semen volume 2ml, ph 7.9, forward progressive sperm 40%, percentage abnormal sperm 89%, sperm count 21 million per ml and incomplete liquefaction after one hour. All my hormone levels were tested and were in the normal range. (FSH, LH, Prolactin & testosterone) A urologist examined my scrotum and prostate via a physical examination and both appeared normal. Can you offer any advice? I do not wish to proceed down the IVF route and Im particularly concerned about my percentage abnormal sperm and the incomplete liquefaction.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor . According to your report your sperm motility is also less along with liquefaction delay and abnormal sperms are more. I suggest you to go for GUI.  It is intrauterine ingestion of sperms. Here sperms are washed and processed, and healthy sperms are placed in uterus. So only good sperms are used. This increases chances of conception. You may go for 4 to 5 cycles of GUI before proceeding to IVF. Hope I have been helpful. Regards Chat Doctor."

Doctors have prescribed sorbiline but still her burning sensation is not cured. Pl. advise. Regards,","Hi. Thanks for your query. Your wife has burning sensation in the lower abdomen. The Ovarian cysts may cause any pains at all if they are simple. Orbiting is not helping. I would advise you the following for your wife:CT scan of the abdomen, tests of blood, urine and stool. A course of an antibiotic and metronidazole should be tried under the guidance of a Surgeon after physical examination and investigations as advised by him."
hello mam my name is krishnamurthy i had got marriage two years back just from two month iam consulting one doctor and i had tested my specimen         in that there is no live or dead sperms is it possible to get sperms pls advice me my mob no is 0000,"Hi Murphy, Welcome to Chat Doctor . Normal sperm count should be more than 20million/ml and motility should be more than 50%. If in your report any parameter is low then you are suggested to start tablets containing combination of zinc, co enzyme Q, lycopene which helps in improving sperm quality and number under your doctor guidance. After taking for 3 months you are advice to repeat analysis.  If improvement is there continue tablet. If no improvement then you are advice to go for assisted reproduction. If there are no sperms at all in your semen then also you are advice to try this medication before going for donor sperms. Also stop smoking and alcohol, reduce weight, have healthy diet. Hope I have been helpful Regards Chat Doctor."
I am scheduled to have a wisdom tooth extracted tomorrow.  I just found out I have a UTI but am not on any antibiotics yet.  Is it okay to have the extraction?  I also have progressive MS so my immune system is compromised.  I am a female and 64 years old.  Thank you.,"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. You can get your teeth extracted after consulting and taking opinion from the general physician. You have to take a prophylactic antibiotic. UTI will have nothing to do with extraction. Consult an oral maxillofacial surgeon and get the tooth removed under local anesthesia. You can start with antibiotics like amoxicillin 500 mg TID for 5 days(if you are not allergic)I hope my answer will help you, take care."
"I am 37 and I was a 14 year smoker of marijuana, probably 6 to 10 joints a day and off and on cigs smoker, maybe the total of 6 cigs a day,for maybe a month then I wouldnt smoke cigs for 5 months, have a few, quit that again for months at a time. I quit both forever 30 days ago, i will NEVER smoke again. I had a bad case of asthmatic bronchitis and that has calmed down, but the asthma has stayed I use a rescue inhaler about once a day at night, because I wake up with an attack and the inhaler almost immediately opens my chest up. I work a physically demanding job where I might do 10 to 40 minutes of fast moving cardio type work about 5 to 7 times a day. I detail cars and when I wash them I move fast, my arms and my legs...the faster I move the more money I make, so I move fast all day. I might have some coughing but no asthma, I have also been waking up in the morning and coughing up mucus that seems to be the route of my chest congestion in the morning. I also got a new puppy thats shedding like crazy and I turned my furnace on because of the winter. Im wondering if I should be concerned with the asthma, or the chest congestion....I will never smoke again so i dont have to worry about that, im just worried i did irreversible damage to my lungs. Is it normal to have chest congestion for this long? Thanks so much","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. It would be advisable for you to get a chest x-ray done. If it is normal then get a PFT done which will tell us how much your lungs are functioning and what is the effect of smoking on them. Consult a pulmonologist for the same. STOP SMOKING before it causes more harm to you.Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."
"Hi, I am married for 5 years and planning for a baby. I had irregular menstrual cycle and visited a Gynecologist in a local clinic. I am undergoing treatment from 8 months and now menstrual cycle is regularized, however not conceived yet. Doctor prescribed to take Gestmate 200, Natural Micronised Progesterone Soft Gelatin Capsules. I am little confused about its side effect and its preventing me from getting pregnant. Please let me know if I can continue taking it.","Hi, Thanks for posting in Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Gestate belongs to a class of hormones called progestins, which is a C-21 steroid hormone involved in the female menstrual cycle, supports gestation and embryogenesis of humans. Progesterone also does the same function, which helps the implantation of fertilized ovum and further carrying pregnancy further. One of the reason why you might be still having delay in conceiving despite taking these medicines could be issues related to the following: 1. Patency of Fallopian tubes, which needs to be assessed by Hysterosalpingography. 2. Status of the ovary and timing of ovulation by doing follicular studies. 3. Semen analysis of your partner. Kindly consult Infertility specialists with the reports after undergoing the above tests for proper evaluation and management. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best."

I can understand your situation and problem. Phenytoin is having Chat Doctor.  So both will interact with each other and decrease their therapeutic levels.

Kindly meet your doctor and discuss this. You need to get complete blood count to see if there is eosinophilic in blood. Generally, people with hay fever have this.

Thank you for posting here. Frequent thirst can be because of blood loss during the extraction. However, this is not considerable.

Nearly four months ago I developed a bad dose of flu. Since then I have not been able to smell or taste anything. I cannot take decongestant tablets because I have hypertension. Could this be permanent or is there still a low grade infection present which might benefit from antibiotics,"Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Your symptoms seem to be related to loss of smell. This is a common complication of flue infection, caused by the dysfunction of smell receptor cells. The lack of taste, may be related to the smell dysfunction (smelling plays a big role in the taste of food). Another diagnosis to consider would be chronic sinus infection. A sinus X-ray study would help to exclude that. This may be just a temporary dysfunction. I would recommend you to consult with a neurologist for a careful physical exam. Some vitamins would be helpful. Best wishes,"
I went to er last night because I almost lost consciousness followed by weaknessand tingling in arms and legsand blood work showed potassium level at 3.0. I was given a large potassium pill and told my symptoms were from anxiety. I believe they were from hypo kalmia  how long will it take me to feel better and what should I be doing to get better. Also had low sodium level,"Degree understand your concerns went through your details. Hypokalemia also hypopotassemia or hypopotassaemia, refers to the condition in which the concentration of potassium in the blood is low.

"Hi, I have an implant that replaces tooth # 8.  Im good floser, and keep my dental visits regular, every 6 months.  On my last check up - there was nothing wrong, but a week ago, I started to have a swollen gum from the inside of tooth #8.  It bleeds in the morning and I could see puss coming out when the gum is pressed.  I never had anything like it before, please advise!Diana",Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Read your query. Bleeding and puss discharge associated with the tissue surrounding the implant suggests inflammation in the gums and presence of an abscess. If untreated can lead to destruction of the implant bone connection leading to the problems in the implant. Medical conditions like diabetes and smoking habit will further worsen the condition. I would advise you to visit your dentist and have it reviewed. The inflammation and infection will usually be cleaned in the affected area and if needed antibiotics will be prescribed. Maintain a good oral hygiene. Have your implant routinely checked. Hope this was useful. Thanks and regards.

He had gastric bypass surgery 8 years ago and has maintained weight of 220 lbs. at 5ft. 9ins. age 66.  He has some arterial blockage being monitored and bp undercontrol with meds.  Should we be concerned","Hi, Low hemoglobin levels, will increase pressure on heart, to pump more for the oxygen to be delivered. If it is below 6-8, it is critical that it should be increased. Iron therapy if iron deficiency is found is ideal. Due to gastric bypass, impaired absorption is going to be present, and he might require injectables.

Thank you for the query. Such liver tests and amylase level indicate some irritation caused by fatty foods, spicy foods, alcohol or even medicines. But it does not seem to be the reason of abdominal pain. If your pain is in the upper middle abdomen, peptic ulcer can be the reason. And it can not be visualized in the ultrasound. Such pain usually appears after some time of the meal. Nausea can be present. I suggest you to have gastrostomy done as a next step. If you are over the age of 50, colonoscopy should be also done.

"hello sir. i am 28 yrs old, male i have lungs scar on my upper left lobe almost 8 years. i never suffer from tb. now i want to god UAE. by GMAC rule of dubai i cant get visa from the scar of my lungs. now im consulting with docter. he ask me to do sputum, PCR, PPD test. then he will be start further treatment. he told me that he will give me tb medicine of 6 months after reading my reports. sir can you tell me that is it possible that i can clear the scar from my lungs with medicine?","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Almost all lung insults whether tuberculosis, pneumonia or lung injury can cause lung scars after treatment. All of them heal with fibrosis and this fibrosis gives scar lesions on chest x-ray for lifelong. So your current scars on x-ray are mostly due to previous lung infection. Since these are inactive, noninfectious lesions, no treatment is needed. These lesions will not go away with any treatment. So to get medical fitness for visa clearance, you should consult pulmonologist and get done 1. CT thorax 2. Bronchoscopy and BAD (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. If both of these are normal then you can argue with visa authority that your lesions on chest x-ray are old, healed, fibrotic, noninfectious. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."

"Hi, I recently fell off my bike and landed on my back damaging the right side of my rib. I was prescribed naproxen for rib damage but no stay was done the pain had subsided for a coupleof days and today I sneezed while sitting down and had a sharp pain down my right side it was an sharp twisting pain and now I am in severe discomfort such as bending,lying and standing I am also uncomfartable sitting down.","Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised. As you had a fall and had rib pain which was healed which all of a sudden started back. Let me make little deep understanding about it. Rib bone is a flat bone and any hairline fracture occurring in that will heal and stop the pain. But sneezing is a high intensified process which will lead to abundant pressure on the rib and the weaker part may get damage again. Also, you need to do some costal breathing exercises as it is the only way to strengthen the internal costal muscles which supports the ribs. If strengthening exercises were done post healing of the fracture than the bones will become stronger and well-supported by the muscles as well. Also, performing now will help to regain the strength in the intercostal muscles, so the support to the respiratory cage is strong and can withstand future injuries.in our clinical practice post injury to the ribs the breathing exercises are taught properly to strengthen the muscles of the intercostal space and maximum benefits are achieved.

So doc told us to try next month. This month she gave me ubiphene 50mg & sitrodyn hp 75 iu from 3rd day of my cycle but ovum size didn t increased from 6 mm. Then she gave me persinal hp 150 I.u. On 7th day I.e. On 22/8/14 but still it is same. I want to know what is going wrong. Ovulation is not happening. It s getting depressing for me. Kindly suggest what to do.","It happens some lifetime that ovary does not respond. Seeing your history in my opinion you should go for IVF, and you should try soon as endometriosis tends to recur and alter ovulation.IVF is a costly affair and while arranging that you can simply try with sphere 200 from d2-6 along with FSH/BMG stimulation from d7 onwards. One more thing I want to tell you after hug injection try to love for 2- 3 days with your husband.thank you"
My daughter has had a cold for almost two weeks. She has had fevers off and on for a week. She is eating very little but I manage to get her to keep fluids in her system. She is not throwing up at. I took her to the doctor yesterday and he said she has bronchitis and gave her antibiotics. The next day her urine was dark. What is going on? She is six years old.,"Since she is having fever, cough since 2 weeks, it is better to get some investigations like blood tests, urinalysis and X-ray chest done to find out exact cause of sucChatDoctorplaints. Dark color of urine might have been caused due to concentrated urine as a result of decreased oral intake and deny Chat Doctor.  Give more oral fluids, ORS solution, juices etc. Antibiotics like rifampicin, metronidazole, sulfsalazine etc. may cause change in urine color, but these are unlikely to be prescribed by your doctor."

"Brief as I can be; I have been sick for the greater part of my life starting with my first hospitalization at 19 months, that was in 1968. They diagnosed at the time double pneumonia, pleurisy and noted a torn tricuspid in the right atrium. Throughout most of my teens I came down with what appeared to be flu like symptoms as well as diarrhea. Usually within a few hours to a day I was running again.  In my late teens and early twenties I was hospitalized so many times with microbacterial pneumonias, again a dose of antibiotics and fluids, running again. Then in my 30s I started having real bad cramps in my lower stomach as well as enlarged lymphnodes in my groin area. Stools have been dark and fluid with mucous present. Wipples disease has been considered and I do believe thats on the right track. However athe biopsies were done in my small intestine with some damage to the villi, (unknown) as well as a flattened duodenum but what showed up was h-pylori that they couldnt eradicate on 4 occasions. I have had lots of episodes of bile being brought up, nausea and of course continued fatty like stools. I wake up with dislocated knees and recently my left leg was somewhat out of socket on the outer hip/leg. My optic nerves have noted atrophy/degeneration noted and I have a spot under the right eye that has stayed with me for about a year now. Its red and flakes with white dead skin daily. My nose and cheeks often show hyper-pigmentation or seemingly fast skin growth(?) Going for the morning ritual for the last three years is excruciating to the point of crying, remember its mostly liquid coming out although a rare hard stool is the worse, almost to the point of passing out. I am treated at present with ms-contin long release, 1000mg twice daily and 10 mils per mg, 3-5 mils every 4 to 6 hours as needed of the liquid morphine. The ytried to used gabapentine but that didnt og over too well and Lyrica doesnt touch it. The liquid morphine lets me do the morning thing with very little pain and formed stools, most of the time no blood and little mucous. in 2008 I contracted MRSA which prevented the treatment for Whipples. All I know is I am exhaustedc within an hour or two of being awake but I deal with it and try to live and work normally as possible but some days are a write off. I am not depressed just bothered with it all. My doctors are giving up, that bugs me but I understand. I also receive lidocane therapy which does help but because they can pin the diagnosis they now wont treat me for Whipples because they cant confirm it. I have even offered to pay for my treatment privately if I had too, it just seems no one wants to take the time. Does anyone know where I can go to get fulfilled help, its just my life! Thank you:)",WITH YOUR SYMPTOMS AND COMPLAINS CLINICALLY IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT YOU DO HAVE RIPPLES DISEASESINCE NO BIOPSY AND CONFIRMATION OD DIAGNOSIS HAS BEEN DONE IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT YOU HAVE IT FOR CERTAIN.STILL SINCE ITS AN INFECTION AND IF IT IS PRESENT TRIAL OF A COURSE OF ANTIBIOTIC SHOULD NOT HARM MUCH CAN TRY TAB DOXYCYCLINE 150 MG ONCE A DAY AND TAB HY Chat Doctor.

i am 18 weeks pregnant. i had off and on bleeding for my first trimester some were very heavy. i stay in Singapore so the doctor here suspected it to be low placenta. After 16 week the bleeding has stopped. My gynac in India has asked me to take Leptaden till end of my pregnancy. Is it safe to take Leptaden?? I had not told my Doctor in Singapore that i am taking this Medicine. this is my 2nd pregnancy.,"Hi, Leptaden is an ayurvedic preparation, usually used after delivery to increase milk secretion. Its efficacy is not tested, and its use is debated.Also, we do not know of what quality the lepta den you will be using will be of, as most Ayurveda medicine are not tested for quality control, so they may be mixed with any other ingredients which could be harmful. I would advise you to avoid the lepta den or any such preparation. For the bleeding, good that it has settled down, now that you are in your 2 trimester. You should ask the doctor to see for placental location when you go for your 20-week anomaly scan. Hope this helps. Regards."
"My Aunt has just been diagnosed (this past week) with Liver Cancer, though not yet sure of stage.  She is 83, 198 lbs (lost 7 lbs in last two weeks), is a 20 + yr breast cancer survivor and in overall OK health.  She was having trouble digesting food, so I took her to Dr.  They then found a tumor in her upper abdomen.  Blood work, CT and endoscopy done (nothing detected in the endoscopy).  The Dr. reached out to me last night (great Dr. - called on a Friday night @ 9:00!) to let me know to be ready for an oncology appt for his upcoming week.  What can I potentially expect?  All that I read tells me that we should be ready for a short life expectancy....  Anything I should know?  Would chemo be an option for someone like this?",Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. All in all these aren't good news. It is questionable is this primary liver tumor or a metastasis. But whatever it is she is definitely not able to stand liver resection or any other surgical procedure. Chemo is also questionable. But you should give your best for palliative treatment and make all this easier for her. It is hard to predict anything but life expectancy is from few months till 1 year if this is malignant. Wish you good luck.
"Hi, In February I was hospitalised abroad after having contracted syphilis and chlamydia at the same time Before admission they tested me for HIV whicChatDoctore back negative (blood test), a week before my admission I did 3 swab tests, all negative. Three days later while in hospital, the doctor came to tell me I was positive, her attending colleague came to see me shortly after and told me not to get upset to worried, the test wasn t positive, it was inconclusive. Her colleague was assuming I was positive because my tcells were so low but after looking at my tests she assumed it was because my immunity had been shot down with the syphilis and chlamydia double whammy. I was released a week later and continued to go for my weekly shots. Within three months my syphilis went from 1:32 to 1:2, the doctors themselves couldn t believe how rapidly my system had fought the syphilis (it apparently takes up to two years), while at home I did another two swab tests which returned negative results. I did another follow up blood test, four months after my stay in hospital and the result is still inconclusive, the doctors just say there is a problem with my blood and the amount of antibodies but cannot seem to see what it is. Could I be positive after so many 5 swab and 1 blood negative? Could it be the syphilis? It has now been 6 months and the latest is still inconclusive. I am not in my own country and the language barrier here doesn t help either","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Syphilis could be false positively came out with using Non-treponemal tests which include venereal disease research laboratory (V Chat Doctor. False positive results could come on the non-treponemal tests following some viral infections such as varicella or measles, as well as with lymphoma, tuberculosis or malaria. There will be a requirement of confirmation tests like treponemal test, such as treponemal pallidum particle agglutination (TPA) or fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-Abs) which are specific tests and could come positive after 5 or 6 weeks following unprotected sexual exposure. So, here I would suggest you to see immediate an infectious disease (ID) specialist for checking and thoroughly clinical examination without bothering about earlier test results. You should be given single dose of Benzedrine penicillin as it is to be given in the uncomplicated cases of syphilis."

Mr. Grimaldi was previously diagnosed as having a posterior pituitary tumor that causes hypersecretion of ADH. He comes to the clinic regularly to have his blood pressure checked. Would you expect his blood pressure to be chronically elevated or depressed? Why?,"Hi thanks for asking question. According to your question you want to know effect of ADH on blood pressure. ADH is called desmopressin. It has property of water retention in tubules and constriction of blood vessels with increase arterial resistance. So obviously it will raise blood pressure along with other symptoms like headache, vommiting and in severe case convulsion. So if he is suffering from ADH secreting tumor then blood pressure will rise. I hope I have solved your query."

"Hi, I am a 45 year old woman.  I am a diabetice of 20 years, I have Mitral valve prolapse, I was recently hospitalized for pulminary embolism and am having terrible hot flashes.  I was wondering if the pulminary embolism was caused by the mitral valve prolapse and could i be having the hot flahes because of this or is it menopause. I am also now on blood thinners and am on insulin.","Hello Mambo MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE cannot cause Pulmonary Embolism (PE). PE is usually an abnormality of the venous system which ultimately links to right side of the heart and Mitral valve is in left side of heart, so it cannot cause it. Yes hot flushes could be a symptom of upcoming or ongoing menopause, as well as it can also be due to your diabetes. Try to keep your sugar levels under control and stay active. Good Luck"

"my friend suffers from diagnosed bronchiectias and gets pneumonia constantly.  She is 72  Each time they give her antibotics for a week and then the xray will show the pneumonia gone, however, it contantly returns.  She has been to Mayo, Iowa City   had many test.  Its beginning to take a toll on her.  I would say she had pneumonia about 6 times last year and so far 2 or 3 this year.  Any suggestions",Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Bronchiectasis is permanently damaged part of lung. So bacterial colonization is common in bronchiectasis. And this gives repeated pneumonia attacks. So best and permanent cure for this is surgical removal of bronchitic part of lung. So consult Cardio thoracic surgeon and discuss surgical removal. Another option is culture and sensitivity based treatment. Get done sputum culture and sensitivity report. Culture will identify the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your friend. Thanks.

He can do a little bit of jello, pudding or eggs. (couple of bites) He also suffered 2 strokes since 2009, so he has lost his speech again. Just in the last couple of days he is throwing up every time I give him his ensure through the feeding tube. Why is he throwing up again??","Hello madam, Sorry for the stage of disease your husband had. As your husband had stage 4 tongue cancer disease means the treatment is palliative (symptomatic) .

"I had a full knee replacement on the 26th January and am now suffering from an itchy rash over my back and now on my shins, my Dr says this could be an allergy to the anaesthetic and now taking antihistamine tablets and applying Cetraben for the last week with some improvement, but rash persisting on leg. What do you think?","Hi and thanks for the query, Its possible that it could be an allergy to an anesthesia, but the duration of the itches deserves exploration of other possibilities of the itches. A blood test in search of raised eosinophil levels to confirm an allergic component. At some point, raise Immunoglobulin E levels might be measured. A thick and thin blood films in search of parasites like microfibril should be actively searched for. A past history of recent travel to an area endemic for parasitic worms shall be of utmost importance. I suggest a good clinical evaluation by your internist and appropriate blood tests be done. Medical conditions like liver disease at times could lead to itches, Thanks and best regards, Luchuo, MD."

"I have a paralysis of long thoracic nerve (right arm) 25 years, winged scapula etc. Take 3600mg Neurontin daily. Had pneumonia in February, still not breathing well, sats of 92.

Have been told, all will sort itself, or my body will just adjust & get used as it has my thoracic nerve dying. Doc mentioned something beginning with Ac----- something, lungs are tight, I want to breathe in, but a nerve, maybe connected to the thoracic nerve is preventing me from filling my lungs. So much to take in, I am 45, I spent 6 years welding in shipyards, breathing lead fumes, zinc fumes, iron filings & have worked with asbestos. No blockage inside lung, been told, there is something stopping me breathing in. Any ideas what could be up with me?","Hello, As there might be a paresis of the thoracic nerve and not paralysis. Because if its paralysis then you need to be put on ventilator support. Since there is breathing difficulties I feel there is a respiratory system pathology due to the work-related factors. Since the inspiration and expiration abilities are lowered in will advise you to look for CPAP machine with oxygen saturation machine. In fact BiPAP will be far better. This will help your pulmonary system to function close to normal and also will help the lungs fill the air. As due to the pathology there is less ability of the alveoli and needs a correction. Medicine is symptomatic and along with that a BiPAP machine with oxygen saturation would do good. Also try pulmonary rehabilitation under guided physiotherapist. As this will help you improve the lung capacities and help you ease of dyspnea. It's a matter of good pulmonary rehabilitation training. In my clinical experience of 12 years most patients with respiratory complications have responded well to pulmonary rehabilitation. Using of the CPAP BiPAP and oxygen saturation is totally dependent upon the clinical findings and this machines can be used at home for large number of hours to improve the overall function of the respiratory system.

I have always had acne since i was 12 yrs old. I was on tretiva 20 twice a week and den once a week for the last 9 mnths. My doctor stopped the course dis mnth n i again have acne on my face. He has now prescribed me clinoxid gel and azithromycin 125mg once a day. The results have not been great. Plz tell me wen wud the treatment show results and will my acne subside like it was wen on tretiva,"Hi. Thanks for your query I would like to mention here that Acne can present in several forms. This includes whiteheads, blackheads, and red, inflamed patches of skin (such as cysts). In the course of evolution, you may have any or all of these. Sometimes, over a period of time, even if you are under a specific for of therapy, one agent might not be enough to handle it completely. This is based on the various internal hormonal stimuli as well, which can change several times in a month or year. Although you have been compliant with the methods advised to you, I feel that only this agent in the lowest dose might not suffice now. There may be a need of addition in oral /topical therapies. U have not mentioned your age now. Tretiva is a medicine which has potential side effects if used continuously, hence it is good to use the other agent now. You can do a few sittings of Salicylic acid peels with qualified dermatologist to attain more sustained results without the potential side-effects of Retinoid therapy. Hope this helps.take care U definitely do not need to stop anything now, however please visit the doctor early so that there are no delays in the onset of more efficacious therapies."

"Hello, I have the Implanon birth control for 5 years 2 rods and always had periods every month just lighter. Im overweight and my doc said that I should change it after 2 years due to the fact of it been less effective . now my period has been late for a week took a pregnancy test and it was negative. Also Im removing my Implanon on 6/18/13 because me and spouse want to try to have a baby, how soon after removing it can I get pregnant. Thanks","Hello, The implant is advised only for 3 years for its efficacy. You have kept it for 5 years. It is better to remove it. The effect of Implant hormone (etonorgestrel) vanishes within 7 days and within 6 weeks you regain your menstruation as previously, So the chance for pregnancy can be expected after your next period. Meanwhile, because of the long duration of keeping Implant check your pregnancy test in blood and confirm the previous pregnancy test result. Best wishes"

hi doctor i took more deriphyllin retard 300 tablet one day before i had heart beats different on that day now i have slight pain while i breath what should i do. i went for apollo hospital on that day they told it will calm down after a while.but now i have pain what tablet i should take now.,"Hi thanks for asking question. According to history provided by you mostly you have pain related to that of excess stress, and it will lead to panic attack if associated sweating and headache also present. Be calm and try to avoid situation that lead to stressful condition. Do yoga and exercise daily. Short course of alprazolam can be taken for anxiety relief after consulting doctor. If you have no stress then it could be just muscular strain by improper sleep posture or heavy weight lifting. Simple analgesic will be effective for it. If still problem continue then you can do chest x-ray for further work up. I hope my suggestion will be helpful to you. Chat Doctor."
"Hello my niece is having a lot of trouble at the moment. Last year she had a operation on her back called Spinal Fusion and once that healed she was pain free and medication free.

Hi I have a doubt. If a girl had sex n she took this i-pill next day only.how long will this pill act.i mean if she again had sex on the day after taking pill is there any chance of being pregnant ? Since these pills changes the hormone level so it shiuld stay for long.,"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. The effectiveness of the morning after pill has not been studied specifically regarding its success rates in preventing pregnancy with multiple episodes of intercourse.  However, sperm remain in the female genital tract for up to 72 hours, which is why the pill is most effective within that window of time.  The overall success rate for preventing pregnancy with the I-pill for one episode of intercourse is 90 percent, meaning 10 percent of the time the woman can conceive anyway. So I would recommend that in this situation that a second dose of the I-Pill be taken, even if the second episode of intercourse was within 72 hours, because live sperm could remain after the first pill has worn off. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. Best wishes,"

I ve had a dull throbbing ache in the right lower part of my abdomen. I just recently got off of birth control (depo provera) after being on it for 14 years. Could I be having symptoms of having a upcoming menstrual cycle already. If not how long to wait to see a doctor if the throbbing pain persists?What a scam.,"Hi. Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. You were on Demo Proverb for 14 years and suppressed the hormonal axis. It will take a lot of time for your body-clock of hormones to set us and hence it is better to check hormone levels. The cause of the right lower abdominal pain can be over-activation of the Ovary, either there is ovulation or so, causing the pain in lower abdomen. It is better to see a Gynecologist and undergo ultrasonography to clear the matter and to have some treatment only if required."
"I have have severe problems with spasticity due to a stroke. I was not a good candidate for Baclofen. My Blood pressure has been very difficult to control. After many trials of different medications, I am now on Edarbi 80 mg in the AM and Amlodipine 2.5 mg in PM and Clonodine 0.1 mg when my systolic goes over 150 and or diastolic goes over 100. The clonodine has always been successful in bringing it down. For reasons not explained to me, my doctor does not want me to take it often. Only when I can t control my pressure. The Clonidine hasn t caused me any side affects. I read that Clonidine has been used to lessen spasticity. Could I use this medication safely and ask my MD to switch me to Clonidine?","Hi, Although Clonidine is a medication for hypertension, which can also help in spasticity, it has several side effects which can be experienced with doses for the above purpose. First-line medications for hypertension are those that you are taking right now - Darby and Amlodipine, which can be titrated for more optimal blood pressure control. Taking Clonidine at higher doses can cause hypotension which is not beneficial and may be harmful as you already had a stroke before.

my father [a 76 year old] is suffering with hipoplastic anemia since september 2008 and given 5 to 6 unit packed red cells every two months.in 2009 he was also implanted with pace maker. doctors say his age is mainly cause  of not implanting bone marrow. is there any treatment to cure him,"**1. Since his age is main concern for not transplanting bone marrow thus two measures left are :i. Supportive care: blood transfusion [already giving] make sure to include: . Growth factors [cause your bone marrow to produce more blood cells especially Erythropoietin (EPO)], Iron ch elation to treat iron overload [a side effect of getting many red blood cell transfusions]PS. Any herb may cause fungal infection, which may be detrimental in situation like plastic anemia, since there is also low white blood cells you may be at risk for infection. Immuno suppressive Therapy: uses medicines to keep the immune system from attacking the bone marrow stem cells, but since lowers body immune response thus alternative treatment can be started/initiated to alleviate the symptoms.2. Daily use of Malawi which contains vitamin C and food containing vitamin E helps to alleviate the symptoms. Eat a well-balanced diet, you may contact a dietitian, nutritionist for counselings. Make sure to check with your doctor before taking any medicines, supplements, vitamins, or herbs. They may interact with your medicines and prevent them from working or increase the risk of side effects. Always carry an ID card that states he has a pacemaker, so that necessary considerations can be carried out, if performing any procedure."

I do not know the best Doctor to go to as I have had very different experiences with them. I wonder if I should go with the new procedure that fits your bones as I have seen on line with Dr. Royce, and is said to be better, or should I just try to find the best Doctor by looking for patients recommendations on line.","Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough Musculoskeletal assessment is advised. As your doctors mentioned you have bone on bone for which TKR is the remedy, I suspect you have arthritis of the knee joint. Also, TKR is a successful procedure to get the pain and other symptoms reduce. Maybe you have too much damage to the ligaments with in the knee joint and now the knee has only swelling and grinding of bone to bone. I will advise you to initially try doing physical therapy, as with this, your pain will be reduced by using the therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy. Then the physical therapist will perform passive ROM exercises to regain the knee bending and later, strengthening of the knee joint and lower limb as a whole, post which if you plan to go with TKR it will be a good outcome sore.

"My mother is 95 1/2 and has dementia. She is frail and has copd. The pa now put her on .25 of morphine for pain which we, her children, haven t noticed her having pain. PA says she is having pain so needs the morphine rather than Ativan and Tylenol. She seems to be sleeping more and responding less since on morphine. We are very concerned. thank you","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, her current symptoms are mostly due to morphine. Morphine is opioid analgesic. It acts directly on brain. Along with analgesic effect, it causes sedation and respiratory depression. So her more sleeping and responding less is mostly due to sedation of morphine. Another reason is high carbon dioxide (hypercarbia). COPD patients are known to develop hypercarbia if respiratory center in brain is suppressed. High carbon dioxide can cause lethargy, sleepiness etc. So better to stop morphine and consult pulmonologist to rule out hypercarbia. Hope I have solved your query.

"Hello doctor, My baby is 36 days old.i am giving him lactozin 1 and breast feeding also but I am worried if I feed him bottle milk then he sleeps for hours but if he is breastfeeded of mine then he sleeps less and feel hungry quickly and urinates more.Doctor what to do? Every one is getting angry not feed bottle milk but if I feed then my baby by no seconds he sleep and stop drinking. Please help me and from last two days he is having gas with peculiar smell,stool once a day but bit tight. Waitting for reply doctor.","Hello madam, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and understand your concern. I would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. In general, I would suggest exclusive breastfeeding (nothing but breastfeeding, even not water) to baby up to 6 months of age. This is because breast milk helps to build immunity of the baby and protects him from many infections. So I would suggest you to try to shift him on only breast milk as early as possible. You can gradually increase breastfeeding and gradually decrease formula.2. It is good sign that with breastfeeding, he is urinating more. But if he feels hungry quickly, it means whole breast is not getting empty. I would like to mention here that the first part of breastfeeding (foremilk) contains more water and the last part of breastfeeding (hind milk) contains more solids. So at present, he is getting more of watery part from breastfeeding. So please make sure that when you breastfeed him, whole of the breast is getting emptied first, then only offer the other breast. This will satisfy his appetite.3. To ensure better nutrition for him, I would suggest you to take plenty of fluids during day and a nutritious diet so that he will get nutrients from the breast milk. Please avoid stress and be relaxed while breastfeeding as it is very important for milk production and milk let down.4. I would suggest you not to worry about occasional gas and change in bowel habits as it is common during first 4-6 months of life. 5. If still he is not satisfied and not gaining weight over time, then only I would suggest you formula or any feeds other than breast milk as per doctors guidance. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you and solves your query. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish your baby the best of the health. Thank you & Regards."

can clarithromycin be given together with children advil to reduce fever (39.6). My son is 5 years old and is been running fever of 39.6 for the last 3 days. I have been giving him advil for fever. I have noticed dark circles arround his eyes and swallen eyes. Is there any and what are side effects when this medicine taken together or shortly after?Thank you very much. worried mom,"Hi... Fever of 3 days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Regards -"
"Dear Sir. I used to masturbate too much now I always feel sleepy dizziness and have also had panic attacks recently. I got selected for Armed force but rejected medically due to excessive high resting rate of heart. Thereafter I started taking inderal tablet; that journey I followed for a couple of months. Now, when I have to talk to someone unknown, present, talk in public I feel very nervous and tensed. I can t involve myself in any helpful activity. Plz suggest any medicine for its recovery. I feel very ashamed to talk in public. When i have to ask question in class I get up to do so but i start shivering, voice go hollow I just seem to fall. I apologize my teacher and move out. Please sir, suggest me any recovery for this.","Thanks for asking in Chat Doctor forum I understand your concern. Please do not hesitate and lose your hope.  There are many reasons for high resting heart rate including anxiety & tension which are normal variants. So, do not feel dejected and take self medications for this.  If you were rejected for this, You always have an option for appeal in military hospitals after taking treatment.  And masturbation is not a disease and is harmless. It is not causing you any weakness/dizziness. So, please visit a doctor for examination and investigating the cause for your problem.  All the best.  Please let me know If I can help you more."
"my son was having fever starting saturday. he was on combiflam syrup. since last 2 days he is having cough and running nose. today the pediatrics administered him livolin and augmentin, after taking the med he vomited sticky bout twice.. is this normal.. he has stopped eating anything past 2 days except for ocassional milk","Hi... Levolin is a medicine for wheezing. Your kid might require it if he has wheeze, if not no need to use it. From Saturday to today its only 3 days of fever and if the kid is active when there is no fever in between then it could probably be a viral illness and it doesn't require an antibiotic like Augmenting either. It could just be a viral cough and cold which will settle spontaneously. Regards -"
"My 82 yo dad is in hospital following several falls. He has a history if heavy drinking (stopped 10 years ago), high blood sugar and irregular heartbeat.  His cholesterol is normal.  He suffers from depression. A CT of brain was normal except for """"extensive confluent areas of low attenuation in white matter, consistent with marked chronic ischemic degenerative change."""" also Mod. To severe diffuse volume loss, marked atherosclerotic calcification of carotid siphons and distal vertebral artery.He has some confusion-- couldnt recall his exact birthday, but he continues to read voraciously .  Could he have suffered a mini stroke?  Does the CT indicate alcohol induced brain damage? With abstinence from alcohol and controlling blood sugar, can his white matter recover or is the loss permanent?  Thank you.","Hi, Thank you for posting your query. CT scan findings denote ischemia-decreased blood flow to brain, mini strokes, which could have occurred due to his diabetes and alcohol intake. Diffuse volume loss of brain is also related to his age as well as alcohol effects. With abstinence from alcohol, good control of sugars, and use of aspirin, we can expect improvement, however, return to complete normalcy is unlikely.

"Hello, I am a 22 year old female. I have been having stomach problems for over 3 weeks. I have been having consistant pain right below my sternum.

My husband has been diagnosed with small cell and did very well with chemo but it grew back in about 4 or 5 weeks. Liver cleared up and some healing in bones but the lung came back twice the size since he stopped chemo in Feb. He feels his oncologist has given up on him and she sent him to do radiation. The last test showed it in brain in about 5 or 6 spots. Do you feel it would be any benefit to get him into a clinical trial and see a new onc.?,"Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is very aggressive cancer of lung. It is very notorious in distal spread and local recurrence. It is highly responding to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. But at the same time it again grows very fast. This is the nature of SCLC. And since your husband is taking chemotherapy and developed local site relapse, this suggests chemotherapy is not giving him benefit. So radiotherapy should be started. And no harm in enrolling in clinical trial or consult other oncologist. But at the same time you should be aware of end result. Life expectancy in SCLC is less than 12-15 months. You have to accept the fate."

It is to inform you that triple negative breast cancers are highly aggressive. High chance of metastasis. Without examining the patient it is difficult to comment on treatment options. But chemotherapy with higher regimes like taxane may be helpful. Exact life expectancy is difficult to predict, and it will depend on response. Consult your oncologist."

My Dad is aged 56 years.He had slight backpain earlier and now it has moved on to the thighs and knees.On scanning it was found that two of the nerves were jammed due to slight movemnt of the disc.The tablet prescribed is WYSOLONE 20 mg for 9 days.I just read through some of the articles and cae to know that this tablet has many side effects.Is it ok to to take these medicines for this pain??,"Cyclone (Prednisone) is a common short-term treatment for inflammatory conditions such as a pinched nerve. If your father is otherwise healthy then this should be no problem. There can be an elevation in blood sugar while on the medication. But since it is only a few days, it is usually safe in otherwise relatively healthy people. If it helps, but then wears off fully, then a lumbar epidural steroid/nerve block injection may well help."

You are sexually active and in a healthy manner which is why you enjoy masturbation, if you would put some more effort into communication with your partner, her can work towards providing the same kind of pleasure you receive through masturbation, if done right. There is no interference masturbation can cause in female fertility. It would although be better if you would go about a little more care during masturbation to make sure hygiene is taken care of. As for conception, sexual intercourse on a regular basis especially on the most fertile days of the month are advised, and there is no other way to it, unless you want to go about artificial insemination ma'am.

"Hi, my son (13 years old) has in the last couple of weeks complained of tightness in his chest. I started him on Claritin for the last ten days and he seemed better, but now complaining again. He says he has shortness of breath at the same time and it isn t painful just kind of uncomfortable. It is 10:36 p.m. here, should I take him to the hospital or wait and make an appointment in the morning with his doctor?",Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done1. Chest x ray2. PUT (pulmonary function test)He may have asthma. So PFT is needed to diagnose asthma. It will also tell you about severity of the disease. Chest x-ray is needed to rule out infection. So I advise you to visit emergency department and start treatment. Once he is stable then consult pulmonologist and discuss all these to rule out asthma.
"hello, Ive recently had IVF treatment that resulted in pg and OHSS. I had 2-3l of fluid in my abdomen as per US and have enlarged ovaries (right one 115mm x 60mm, left 93mmx74mm. There were still some follicles present when i had the US (1/6). I am feeling OK now, just noticed a lumpy feeling in my right side of the lower abdomen. I am worried about this. Can this be the enlarged ovary that I feel? its just under the bellybutton on the right side",Hi welcome to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your question. You have lumpy feeling due to very large ovaries due to enlarged follicles and this much fluid may be due to rupture of follicles as a consequence of HSS over stimulation. So I would advise you that stop treatment for 1/2 cycle and consult gynecologist for further treatment. Hope I answered your question. Would be happy to help you further. Take care.

I received a shot for nausea a few weeks ago and Im still experiencing a bit of localized numbness at the injection site. Ive been doing some self-massage and stretching which seems to be helping a bit. Should I continue this or do I need to see a doctor?,Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concern... As per your complaint numbness at the injection site is due to injury to the nerve endings by the pricking injection needle at the site of injection and the nerve injury leads to numbness. The time duration in which the numbness or the nerve injury will resolve is unpredictable and can take from a few weeks to months to resolve. But mostly complete resolution is seen in such cases. You can do warm compresses over the region and continue doing stretching for faster relief. Nothing else is needed as of now. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.
"hello, i have just taken the plan b pill after a condom broke. i am scheduled for general physical and pap smear in 2 days. i read somewhere the pill can affect the results of the test. should i rescedule for a later date? does the pill induce your period? thank you","Hello, The plan B pill does not affect the cervix or the pap smear result, so I do not think you will need to reschedule the examinations another time. On the other hand, the plan B pill may cause your menstruation to be one week earlier or one week later, so you may have your periods when you do not expect them. In this case, if you are bleeding, the doctor may decide not to do the pap-smear because the presence of blood may affect the results of the pap smear. I hope this answers your query. I remain at your disposal for further medical assistance."

Thanks for giving good history. Since it is allergic rhinitis you have to use intro nasal steroid (Alone) is the gold standard according to WHOm.

Dust, mite, fine dusting powder, sudden increase and decrease of temperature, pollen, mold, hay, fodder, fine cotton fibers in air, all these are predisposing factors responsible for asthmatic allergic bronchitis.

Did you do any test from the collection within the lymph nodes? If yes, then please mention the pathological reports; If not please do an FNAC test with AFB/Fungal smears also; this is necessary for a definitive diagnosis and to plan the line of treatment!

I have been recently tested for low B12 levels because I have been having leg pain. Now for the past two weeks I have been having dizzy attacks and feel like I could actually pass out for a second or two. My B12 level was 278. Could this be the cause of my dizziness. I also have a headache when this occurs in the sinus area of my face.,"Hello dear friend, I can sense that you are getting anxious about your vitamin B12 levels, but 278 is not low but within normal range(towards lower side but still above the defined limit for low levels as anything above 200 is normal). Even if low, it would have caused symptoms related to anemia(usually pallor, fatigue, palpitations,breathlessness) or neurological deficits like impaired joint position, inco-ordination of body parts, limb weakness or stiff legs. In my clinical experience of a few years, I have not encountered patients of B12 deficiency causing prominent leg pains or people getting episodes of dizziness due to vitamin B12 deficiency(dizziness although you may be a part of anemia sometimes). I would suggest you to go to a neurologist, and he will, after analyzing your history and examination, will tell you about the possible causes of dizziness in your case, which can be several otherwise, like postural hypotension, positional dizziness, some ear pathology and a few others. I hope it helps you."

May contribute to high BP if not the cause of high BP, another thing is kidney problems, so you must check renal functions and a Renal ultrasonographic examination. Use of a lot of salt or analgesic may contribute to high BP. Lack of physical activity may be another. Salt restricted diet and regular walking exercise 3=4 km /day should improve it. Family history of Diabetes so do not forget to check Blood sugar level twice a year. Stop taking Oral contraceptive pills with consultation of your treating Physician. Good Luck"

"I suffer from osteoarthritis in my spine and have been on the steroid Prednisolone (5mg) for almost 40 yrs for asthma.

For the past 7 days however, Ive tried to cut it further, so have been taking the Prednisolone every 2 days because of my osteoarthritis, but my lower back is in a lot of pain.

As an aside, I take 2 chewable calcium tablets daily and take Alendronic 75mg once a week too.",Dear patient Prednisolone is a steroid Chat Doctor.  It also leads to osteoporosis.  Since you were taking Prednisolone for prolonged period you get habituated to it. Sudden change in dosage leads to relapse in symptoms. Your back pain might be related to change in dosage. Please do not bring sudden change in dosage. Since you were taking it on alternate days try taking half tablet on alternate days for a week and then next week again take further half dose and stop over a period of one month.  If you feel your asthma symptoms are relapsing then do not hesitate to again starting previous dosage. I would also like to advise radiograph of lumbosacral spine anteroposterior and lateral views to rule out bony abnormalities. All the best.

"Hi my age is 32 Years, I had a follicle study done. It reads as follows ; 9th Day - ROF & LOF : No DF - ET : 5.6mm, Collection in POD : Free 11th Day - ROF & LOF : No DF - ET : 7mm, Collection in POD : Free 13th Day - ROF & LOF : No DF - ET : 8mm, Collection in POD : Free What does the above report indicate ? Is there any chance of getting pregnancy ?","Hi, I appreciate your query would clarify the report of your follicular study to you. On the 9th day, in the right and left ovaries (OF and LOF) - there was no DF - which means, dominant follicle. Again the same findings persisted till the 13th day, that is there was no dominant follicle in any of the ovaries. ET - refers to endometrial thickness which was 8 mm on Day 13. Collection in POD was nil, which is normal. Now, to explain a normal follicular study to you. By day 9, the ovaries start producing dominant follicles, that is among the many eggs present in the ovaries, one starts maturing to develop into the dominant egg for that month. By day 13 generally, if you have a regular 28-day menstrual cycle, the dominant egg reaches a size of 20 - 22 mm. Generally on day 14, ovulation occurs, that is the mature dominant egg is released from the ovary, and it is then ready for fertilization by the sperm. This is the normal studyHowever, in your case, there is no dominant follicle seen till day 13, which means that you are having an ovulatory cycle. That is, no mature egg is developing for ovulation this month. Anovulatory cycles are a major cause for not being able to conceive.POD (Polycystic ovarian disease) is one of the leading causes of an ovulation, apart from other conditions. You need to consult a gynecologist, and undergo further investigations for POD to rule out the cause of this follicular study. Also, you might require treatment and ovulation induction (medicines to stimulate formation of follicles in the ovary). In case your cycles are delayed (longer than 28 - 30 days), there is a minor possibility that your follicles are maturing later than normal, for e.g., in a 35-day cycle, the day of ovulation would be 14 days before periods, that is on day 20 or 21. Hope this helped you."
"hello Dr,My mom had a stone removed in April 2013 .A stent  was placed which was then removed in May 2013. Then after a week she had severe kidney infection and was in the hospital for a week . Now she again started complaining of pain in the lower abdomen. A scan was done and a 6 mm stone was seen in the left kidney. The doctor has prescribed noculi tablets . She also is taking tabs for high BP and blood sugar. I just wanted to know whether anything else should be done,,",Good Day! If your mom doesn't feel pain then I would guess your doctor is trying to treat the 6 mm stone conservatively. Three indications to say that conservative treatment has failed are :1) Uncontrolled pain 2) intractable vomiting and 3)fever. If you have any of above-mentioned symptoms then you may need to go to the ER and have the stone removed by endoscopy. I hope I was able to give you a satisfactory answer and best of health to your mom.
My mother is a complete bed patient. She had undergone brain operation. Now her condition is not at all good. She is at home. Now her chest is congested with cough. I am arranging for suction.

That is a very significant question and I appreciate your problem. I will try my best to answer your queryDuolin, the medicine is a bronchodilator. So it helps expand the lungs, which makes the patient feel more comfortable when breathing. However, I am not convinced with the idea of using it without testing. Secretions so much so that you need to arrange for suction suggests that there may be an ongoing infection in the lungs. It would be a good idea to get an x-ray of the chest, Since you are already getting the suction done, a suction sample may be sent for cultures, This will tell us the bacteria growing and the antibiotic suitable to treating the infection hope this helps you.

I have a diagonal crease on my right ear lobe and have had for at least 20 years (if not more). I am a 44 year old woman and take statins for cholesterol (purely preventative measure). My father (who was a GP) died at 61 years old with a sudden stroke and my GP said my cholesterol was at the high side of normal and that statins would be a good measure. I do not have blood pressure. Is this crease a definite indicator of heart disease? Many thanks. RJ,"Hello, I would explain that there are many studies which indicate that ear crease is an independent cardio-vascular risk factor.  Anyway, dyslipidemia, family history are other independent risk factors. For this reason, I would agree with your doctor on the description of statins for dyslipidemia.  It is also recommendable to closely monitor your blood pressure values and follow a healthy lifestyle (regular physical activity, avoid smoking and alcohol and follow the Mediterranean diet). Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

Patients post-surgery need medication, so they develop good healing and don't develop an infection.  This medication may lead to stomach upset and reduced bowel movement forming acidity in the stomach. Also, the lack of mobility is one of the reason. Now since after having loose stools you have developed another side effect I will request you to speak to your doctor for the same. As he will be the right candidate to examine and prescribe the necessary medications. As it needs a physical examination I will direct you back to your surgeon for the same.

I am 23yrs old & suffering from aplastic anemia since last 3 yrs.and dr said no transplant is also required but there is no change in blood cnts since then and they are fluctuating.......and i am much active also and do my regular schedule too .so plz can any1 provide me an 2nd opinion for it,HST(hematopoietic stem cell transplant) is an option for treating plastic anemia.  But decision to go for a transplant depends on several factors. Matched donor is one such factor in allogenic transplant. Repeated blood transfusion before transplant increases failure chance. Although young patients like you are a good candidate for transplant the decision entirety depends on individual situation. Recently various research have shown chromosomal structure(telomere) also has an impact on outcome of the therapy chosen.  So it is complex decision.  If were your treating physician I had suggested you to consult a hematologist for best judgment.  Wish you good health.

"I am 26 year old female battling infertility issues.   I have been trying to conceive for two years ( 9 months with an infertility doctor).  I have had a laproscopy (sp) and the only thing that was found was  cysts on the outside of my tubes.  The doctor stated this was nothing to worry about.  I have been on Clomid now for 9 months.  Everything I have found online states you should not take it more than three cycles.  I recently went back to the doctor on July 1st and nothing was changed.  The only thing was that I did not have a cycle in June, so he placed me on Medroxypr AC 10mg.  I am now on day 8 of 10 and still no cycle.  I asked him if he thought my Crohns Disease could be affecting my infertility or the absorption of the Clomid ( as in the past I have had trouble with absorption of birth control due to my Crohns Disease).  He stated no.  Do you think it is time for a second opinion? Do you have any suggestions?","Hello, Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. Forum. Cyst near the tube, but what is the size of cyst?

Hello its kind of new for me to consult online also there is a concept that if you are physically present in front of adoctor it gives him much more information of the disease and the status of the patient.I have been recen6ly diagnosed of BPH and also came to know that their are chances of cancer prostate.Iam utterly confused of this sudden malady at the age of 60.would you be kind enough to clarify me on this.Thanking you in advance. YYYY@YYYY,"Hi, Thanks for writing in. The chances of prostate cancer with BPH is less likely. However, if you have a BPH then it is suggested to get blood PSA level test done. This is prostate specific antigen and is a marker for prostate cancer.PSA is normal up to 4 NG/ DL. More than 4 NG/ DL is an intermediate risk for prostate cancer and above 10 NG/ DL should be evaluated for possible prostate cancer. The PSA test might be done every year after 60 years of age. Having BPH is common in the elderly with 10 percent of males having it at 60 years and 80 percent at 80 years. Please do not worry."

Hi i have got a fungal infection as well as allergic swell. how well propygenta can be helpful if i use it with micogel,"Hi!moving, Welcome To Chat Doctor forum, Fungal infection and allergy are two different things and both require different kind of treatment. Correct diagnosis of the two is important. Propygenta is a combination cream of steroid and antibiotic cream, used in case of allergy or eczema and not for fungal infection. Micogel is an antifungal cream. So both these cream have their own indication. Together they should not be used at the same place. But if one wants to use it at two different places then it can be used. It would be good to consult a dermatologist before using these creams. Regards, Chat Doctor."

"My 13 year old son has strep throat. When he eats or drinks he has to spit out a lot of saliva. Is excessive saliva normal. He is 13, 170 lbs, has environmental, peanut, and seafood allergies. He has been on keflex for three days and this morning would be his fourth day but he could not keep the keflex down I think more because of a throat reflex issue with the spitting which made him throw up than a stomach issue.","Hello, I can understand your concern. Your son must be experiencing pain while swallowing due to infection in throat. This might cause pooling of saliva in the mouth that he is not able to swallow without pain causing him to avoid swallowing altogether if not needed. So the amount of saliva produced in mouth may be normal, but its defective swallowing might make it pool out of mouth. For complete relief of the throat infection, he will have to complete the entire course of the antibiotics. By the time the course is finished, he should be feeling fine regarding the throat and saliva problems. If not, you should consult your ENT specialist again for further advise. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. Let me know if you have follow-up questions. Best,"

From past 3 and half years we didnot get pregnency.testing did and report saying sperm count was less means 16 million.last 1 year back it was 30 million but inyesterday report it is 16 million.please help me what i have to do.I consulted doctor and they told to take miraqule capsules,"Hi, they might help and there are many Ayurvedic preparations which help in increasing sperm count. But what is not understood is why there was no conception even with a count of 30 mills which is not very low. Have you had a Semen culture done to rule out any infection?

"My son had a kidney stone removed after having a stent put in for a week. Then he got sick with a stomach virus, I guess, or could it be an infection from kidney. Urgent care dr. said it could be from kidney, urologist says it can t be because there s no blood in his urine. He s on antibiotics. Does he have to have blood in his urine to have the infection be related to the kidney? Thank you, Carol","Good Day, and thank you for being with Chat Doctor ! To really determine if there is infection in the urine, you'll have to do a urine culture. This is the gold standard to confirm a urine infection. Blood in the urine may accompany pus cells.

In case you are asymptomatic, you just need to wait and watch by abstaining from alcohol and discuss with your clinician regarding any medication which you are on.

"I am a 61 yr old Male. I was admitted to hospital for myoclonus , chorea and ataxia . drs pointed it to chronic b12 deficiency & I was treated accordingly with Inj. Vitcofol (7 injections alternate days) and following that Inj. Optineuron (3 injections alternate days). I also had Vit D deficiency. Was given Vit D3 60,000 IU a chewable tab once a week for 4 weeks. I was also prescribed Lonazep 0.5 for anxiety and my sleep disorder . It dint help much, so dr asked to add Stressnil 0.5 mg in addition to that. I was given a drug called Haloperidol when my dr was treating me for chorea, but it led to difficulty in swallowing ( dysphagia ) due to the effect of which I lost my ability to even swallow my own saliva for over 3.5 days and gradually my swallow reflex has returned back. Every day they gave me phenergan and in 3.5 days i felt better.Today I felt a mild numbness in my left thumb and my dr has asked me to stop Lonazep 0.5 and instead take Tab Stalopam 10 mg once daily at 8 pm. My question is : Is this a safe tablet ? In addition to the mentioned medications, I also take Telmikind 40 mg for bp, Ecospirin 75 mg (as my brain MRI showed small vessel ischemia Grade-I) , Tonact ( Atorvastatin ) 10 mg & Dutas-T for my BPH (prostate) problem. I am very apprehensive about starting Stalopam. Why is the new tab prescribed & would I suffer any side effect because of this new tab ?","Hello Mr.faith Chorea, ataxia and myoclonus may occur in severe vitamin-B12 deficiency.

"While having a physical examination, a young male informed his doctor that at age 8 he had lobar pneumonia and pleurisy in his left lung. The physician decided to measure his VC. Describe the apparatus and method used for taking this measurement. Define the following terms used in the description of lung volumes: TV, IRV, ERV, RV, and VC","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand concern. TV is tidal volume. IRA is inspiratory reserve volume. ERV is expiratory reserve volume. RV is residual volume and VC is vital capacity. All these are lung volumes and capacities at different phases of respiration (inspiration & expiration). Since patient is having past history of pneumonia, it is better to check lung condition at present before recruitment. Past history of pneumonia can cause permanent lung damage and decrease in lung functions. So better to check before recruitment. Volume of air during normal breathing is TV. Volume of air present in the lungs after deep forceful inspiration is IRA. Volume of air expired after deep inspiration is ERV. Volume of air moving in and out after forceful breathing is VC. Volume of air present in the lungs after forceful expiration is RV. All these calculations are made by spirometer. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your patient. Thanks."

Thanking you doctor, Respect fully, Sathish.V","Degree understand your concerns went through your details. Cricket ball hitting on your groin area many times cannot cause the given problems. Bend penis is normal and is good for you because bend penis will give you more pleasure within a vagina than a straight penis. When semen is ejaculated, automatically your penis will become slack mainly because of blood Chat Doctor.  That is also normal. You should not try doing masturbation again. Wait for at least 1 hour. You are already 26. You should reduce masturbation frequency to two or three times a week. There is no need to abandon intercourse.

"Hi, I m of 32 yrs of age and have mild fatty liver (doc said grade-1). All my blood test reports (LFT, CBC, Cholestrol etc) are normal. He suggested me to take Heptral 400 mg twice a day for 15 days. Can you please suggest if I should take this tablet or not since there is no abnormalty in my blood reports?

Losing weight to near ideal weight would be helpful. I am very glad that all your liver tests were normal along with the lipids. Occasionally, there may be an over diagnosis of this condition by someone studying the sonogram or maybe some technical error. In any case, You don't seem to have serious problem.

"Hello Doc, first I must say that this is very novel idea and I really appreciate your time and efforts. Now to the problem - My wife is suffering from dust allergy or I think called dust rhinitis or something from last 15 yrs or something.....She sneezes around 30 times a day and constantly has runny nose.  She sometime also has Asthama problems. She has taken lots of allopathy and homeopathy tablets but to no solution. If you can suggest me some remedy or a good ENT doctor in Mumbai, I would be really grateful to you. Many Thanks.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, As you are wife has known allergic to dust, she should be very careful otherwise it may be dangerous to the life. I would suggest her to undergo absolute eosinophil count (AEC) which will be raised in the allergic condition. For the present symptoms you can give her Tab Monte LC which helps to control the symptoms, but it is temporary. She needs to avoid these dust allergens to protect herself from getting these allergy symptoms. I would suggest her to undergo skin prick test (SPT) to identify the type of dust causing these symptoms and can prevent herself from exposing to this dust. Otherwise, you can prefer immunotherapy either with subcutaneous immunotherapy (SUIT) or sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT). Thank you."
Hi Doc. My blood pressure is 168 over 96. Please advise whether it is ok. I have been diagnosed in 2014 and since then I have been on tablets called Lisoretic 10/12mg. On 13 August I felt dizzy and collapsed and when I checked it was 37 on the lower side. Since that day my doctor said I must not take my tablets because my Bp is low. I habe been checking every day up to now the readong is as above. Please advise,"Hello, Mentioned readings is high only. Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly thrice a day for one week then once or twice a week. If BP is persistently more than 140/90 MMH, then you should be on medicines for it. Depending upon your BP readings we'll add medicine like Amlodipine. We'll also need to adjust the dose to prevent low BP.  Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according your capacity at least 30 min a day and 5 days a week. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish once or twice a week, avoid meat. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. There shouldn't abdominal fat deposition or obesity. Get your lipid profile and sugars tested once.  Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."

I have also had an ECG which was good, My lungs don t feel congested and I am not coughing up anything","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Your ECG is normal, and your symptoms are not improving with antibiotics and inhalers, so no need to worry about heart and lung related diseases. Sometimes stress and anxiety can cause similar symptoms. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution.

Hi.I found my 1 n half yr old son with an opened odomos naturals mosquito repellent cream & he seems to have just tasted it. ( not sure of the quantity he ate) i washed his hands n mouth immediately and he was normal. No vomiting. Aftr 1 hr he breastfeeded and slept. Is anythin to be worried or concerned?,"Thanks for posting your query at Chat Doctor. Demos contains a neurotoxic substance that can cause symptoms including stomach upset. If it is more than 4 hours after he could have taken it, stomach wash would not be helpful. If he is ok at the moment you can wait and observe and no need to worry. In any case if he has not ingested it, there is not much to be concerned. But in case of any sort of complications, rush to a hospital. Please do not try to cleanse his stomach on your own. Hope that helps. Feel free to revert in case of further queries if any."
Hi i am a nursing student an am wondering? i have a patient that i am doing a composite on. she was admitted with abdominal pains and i am specificlly looking at her AST and ALT values. Her AST was 65 U/L and ALT 59 U/L on admittance. She has had a whipple procedure done for pancreatic cancer previously and on this recent visit had a nephrostomy tube inserted. I dont think this would have caused a large decrease in these values but her AST went down to 30 and her ALT went down to 29 after her 5 day stay in hospital. Could you please give me some insight into why these would have fallen so much after being so high in such a short time. Like i said the only procedure that was done was the tube and her pain medication of MS contin was increased from 30mg up to 60mg upon discharge .,Hello! Thanks for putting your query in Chat Doctor. I am a Gastroenterologist (DM). You haven't mentioned why nephrology tube was placed. Anyhow if there was some infection due to obstruction in urinary tract then after relieving the obstruction the sepsis must have improved that may lead to improvement of AST/and ALT. I hope I have answered your query and this will help you. Remain in touch and get-well soon.

Dear sir iam 25 years old and iam suffering from hair loss ie almost 50% is gone Iam using mx5 now ie I started just 10 days before. Previously I used tugain 5% and just changed to mx5 and will the change of brand will cause hair fall and will the body weight will impact hair fall? Please advice . Two years back I used minoxidol 10% but suddenly I was loosing more hair so that s why I switched to 5% . Iam living in bangalore please suggest some hair clinic and wil plasma rich protein work fine for me where is that treatment done in bangalore please advice.,"Hello, I can understand your concern you may have halogen effluvium or an Chat Doctor. Hairfall may be due to lack of nutrients like iron or proteins in body, it may also be due to deranged thyroid levels. So to rule out halogen effluvium I would advise you to get your he, serum ferritin and thyroid levels tested.it may be genetic or due to hormonal changes too. Application of minoxidil and oral biotin once a day can really be helpful to you. Minoxidil is slow method, it takes time to show results, and you have to be compliant with its use, leaving it abruptly can again result in hair loss. So be patient and keep using it and changing the brand or weight do not make any difference. Still if you don't find any results you can go for procedure like PRP (plasma rich platelet) therapy, it could help you as results seen are very good. And you can consider hair transplant too. Hope it would help. Thank you"
"I have been diagnosed with hbp for over 10 years now, and I take medication (Losartin 100mg) once per day.I monitor my bp everday, and today my reading was 130/72.I have been experiencing lower back pain, muscle spasms in the abdominal area, legs, etc...I have also had low grade headaches that radiates to all sides of head, and soreness behind my eyes. Sometimes I feel a bit dizzy as well. Something just feels off.","Here lower back pain can be due to back muscle strain. And spasm in back muscle comes due to weakness of spinal muscles as well due to working in wrong posture for a long time. Abdominal muscle spasm is actually not a proper symptom you need to say more in this like is there any discomfort in abdomen ?, or do you have diarrhea?, do you have this problem from long time or started recently?, how is your bowel and gastric health? Then only we can give you proper guideline. Now spasm in leg muscle could be related to long-standing or related to back pain only. But to get diagnose properly I suggest visiting or tho or physio and get your self examined properly for evaluation purpose. Here you are complaining of headache and soreness in eyes as well I strongly believe this all symptoms together indicates your body is in too much stress. You need some time to rest and relax your self. So take a break and even after that if It's not fine then do visit doctor for proper health check up. Take care."

The most common causes of recurring fungal infection include inadequate treatment, not maintaining personal hygiene and increased sweating in those areas which predispose to repeated infection. I am also suspecting antifungal resistance in your case which could be the reason for recurrence. I suggest you undergo a fungal culture and sensitivity for a skin sample from the groin area and get a prescription for an appropriate antifungal based on the test results. This treatment has to be continued till 6 weeks at least to avoid recurrence. Keep those areas clean and Chat Doctor. Avoid tight underwear and clothes to decrease the sweating in those regions.

Hi I have been on the Nuvaring for 2 years. Worked always great. For the first time I decided to skipp a Period so I did what my Gyno suggested to leave it for 4 week and then insert a new ring right away. I still got my period(lighter and shorter) and then I spot bleed for 2 weeks still with the ring in. On the third week on this second ring I took it out and my period didnt come. Is that normal? I am experiencing some bloating and light cramps. The free ring week passed and I inserted a new ring. So. On this cycle no period???? Im just wondering if this is normal do to me stacking the rings? Or can I be pregnant? I was always in the ring so I am confuse,"Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. Insertion of the ring can cause some menstrual irregularities, so the delay in period could be due to that. This was followed by the insertion of another ring, not giving your body a chance to go about the complete cycle which would have eventually resulted in a period. Stacking of rings is not a problem, but you will have to experience your period at least once in a month or 2, or else this can lead to some repercussions. Your question is quite good. Yes, in such situations, it is always advised to rule out pregnancy, and so I would advise a home pregnancy test, using an early morning urine sample which would be most concentrated. Repeat the test every 5-7 days; totally conducting it 3 times. This will help in finding a pregnancy if present. Once a pregnancy is ruled out, wait till you experience a period before inserting the next ring. If there is a further delay, do not hesitate to visit your doctor regarding the same. I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for. Please feel free to write back to me for any further clarifications at: http://doctor.ChatDoctor .com/doctors/ Chat Doctor.  I would gladly help you. Best wishes."

Usually post extraction of wisdom tooth is associated with fever, headache,ear and jaw pain. But all these symptoms lasts for 2 weeks. Chat Doctor. IN your case, since the headache and sinus infection lasts even after 7 years of tooth extraction, chances of nerve damage or sinus penetration has to be ruled out.

"Hi I am a mother of a 4.5 year old boy. My son has a problem with stool witholding for about four months now. He solis his pants with some stool from the 3 rd day from the last bm. He goes about every 8 days, or sometimes 6 or 7. He sits on the potty couple times a day it seems he will produce a stool, it smells, but the he witholds and the stool doesn t come out. I think he is afraid that it will hard him when he goes. He got constipated around august, hte stool was after 8 days, very hard and some blood on it. He had an infection of the throat then and didn t want to eat anything, so I gave him some chocolate desert he likes and some other things that made him constipated, because I was afraid he didn t want to eat and loose wait, not be able to fitght the infection. Since then he has been witholding the stool. I went to the peditrician, she said to take decoman and that didn t work so we tried lactulose, after that was no improvement in frequency and he had cramps and his behavior was different. He was irritated a lot. I look him of lactulose and I don t know what to do next. He had an ultrasound, but it didn t show anything specific. The doctor who preformed the ultrasound said that there is some fecal matter in the stool. Now doctor is saying he needs an x-ray with contrast or somethin. I would be thankfull for any advice. I don t know how to help my son, so he can go more often and the stools are not as hard. I give him prunes, otmeal, fresh apples and pears.. he doesn t eat nay chocolate or bannanas-nothing that will make him constipated more.

I am Chat Doctor. I appreciate your concerns. You need to take Pill again to prevent pregnancy. The tablet you took on 1st will not work for this sex on 3rd. The bleeding you had on 18th is because of the Pill. Since you have taken Pill several times in this cycle your period may be erratic for this month. It is difficult to predict when you will start the period. With the Pill you will be using again you may start your periods within 10 days. Unless you both remind yourselves of the need to use condoms, it is difficult to control such episodes. Please understand that Pill should not be used as contraception. Discuss with your doctor and use regular contraception like birth control pills as they are more effective than Pill in preventing pregnancy. I hope this is helpful. If you have further concerns, I will be happy to answer. Best wishes, Chat Doctor."

She has no record of any heart diseases, but she have had really little hours of sleep recently.Thank you.Best RegardsKoo","Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Well, if this hard heart beat is also associated sometimes with a shortness of breath, combining with the lack of sleep and/or with the usage of energetic Chat Doctor.  In young ages and when they are not usual phenomenons within a day, there is nothing to worry about. Stressful moments in life, physical or psychological, can be associated with extrasystoles. If this is a worrisome event to her and to you, I recommend her to be put on a 24-hour Holder rhythm monitor, to determine exactly what are these phenomenons, and if they are present, are there enough episodes a day to warrant treatment (because there is a cut-off line in the number of extrasystoles that can be tolerated). Instead, there is the option of the episode rhythm monitor - a machine who can be turned on and off by user, when he/she experiences the symptom. When the readings are ready, I suggest you to consult a cardiologist or feel free to ask me again. I hope I was helpful. Take care. Best regards,"

My other three wisdom teeth (top and bottom left) have all come in straight and I have not needed to have them removed but my lower right wisdom tooth is cutting through the gums right now and for the past 9 days, I have experienced some aching near the site.  (Nothing too severe, mostly just a dull ache.)For the past 5 days, I have had some pus oozing out from underneath the gum where the wisdom tooth is erupting.  The pain is mostly gone, but I am wondering what I can do to bring the bad-tasting/ smelling pus flow to a halt.  I do no feel the need to go to the dentist or doctor since it appears to be improving day by day.What would your suggestions be?  Do I require antibiotics for this minor infection?Thank you!","Hi, Thanks for asking the query, According to your symptoms I suppose that you have developed infection at the site of extraction this could be due to food lodgment or there could be presence of any broken root piece an x-ray of the region is required. At home take lukewarm saline and antiseptic mouthwash rinses. Take a course of antibiotics and analgesics. Avoid consumption of hot and spicy foodstuffs. Hope you find this as helpful, Regards."
"Respected Sir, My name is vivek,I am 22 years old and suffering from neurofibroma since last 5 years.There are around 6 to 7 glands in my body mainly in left forearm and in my back.Sir if there is any cure then please tell me the appropiate medicines for it.","Hello, Unfortunately, you harbor a condition referred to as NEUROFIBROMATOSIS.  I very much wish there were a definitive cure for your problem by using medication, but there are none of the types you seek in order to reverse the presence of the neurofibromas in the left forearm and back.  Sometimes if the neurofibromas become so large that they cause unrelenting or excruciating pain on a structure in its vicinity then, surgery can be done to remove the fibrous.  The problem, however, is that they tend to come back after time and secondly. Sometimes the lesion is so enveloped around or within a nerve or group of the nerve that surgically removing is not easy or even recommended. Since the nerve itself would have to be sacrificed and this has other consequences compared to pain or other feelings of neuropathy. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor."
I am 37 year male and I have a white spot in the roof of my mouth. I took a treatment which includes multivitamins and retinol cream to apply.

"Dear Doctor, I am 37 years old. I have been married for 9 years and trying for a baby for last 3 years. First time I am taking treatment from an IVF center. Recent report shows my wife is OK and my sperm analysis report shows Sperm Count= 2.5, Motility =20% and Normal form 05%. Conclusion of the report shows actively motile sperm was not found . Does it mean that i have no ability to get my wife pregnant ? Please suggest i am in a tense. Thanks","HelloYour semen analysis report is definitely not normal. At such a low count, with no actively motile sperm, the chances of pregnancy are very less. Normally, GUI (intrauterine insemination) is recommended for low sperm counts, but in your case, the normal forms are also few and motility is nil. I would advise you to consult an Chat Doctor. Some forms are treatable, whereas others are not. Please do not lose hope, as there are options such as IVF (in vitro fertilization) and CSI (intro cytoplasmic sperm injection) for an extremely low count also. Take care."

The important clinical differentiating point is that headache due to sinusitis generally also has concomitant pain when pressed over the sinuses. You can check that yourself by pressing on both sides close to your nose and above your eyes for sinus tenderness. Another evaluation is sinusitis is CT scan of paranasal sinuses.Also, if EMAIL and Neurontin are not working it is more likely for sinus headache than migraine.

I have been taking  Metformim for two weeks doctor has me taken 1 pill at night for 1 to 2 weeks. Since I started this I have small blisters on my hands. My blood sugar has decreased from 240 down to 140 or 130 in the mornings and lowers during the day tonight it was 114.

Will the blisters go away?,"Hi there, Thanks for your query. Firstly, Metformin has brought down your blood sugar to within desirable range, though the morning (empty stomach) blood sugar is still high. There is thus, a need of increasing the dose of metformin; or, addition of another Chat Doctor. Metformin is detoxified and thrown out of the body predominantly by the kidneys.

I am certain that he will agree with me, order required tests, and-based on the reports-will prescribe suitable/modified treatment as advised.

They do not accept pulmonary certification even if it scars..,"Hi, In active Pulmonary TB, infiltrates or consolidations and cavities are often seen in the upper lungs with or without mediastinal or Hilary lymphadenopathy. However, lesions may appear anywhere in the lungs. In HIV and other immunosuppressed persons, any abnormality may indicate TB or the chest x-ray may even appear entirely normal.  Old healed tuberculosis usually presents as pulmonary nodules in the Hilary area or upper lobes, with or without fibrotic scars and value loss Bronchiectasis and pleural scaling may be present.  Herbal Remedies.  1, GARLIC may boost the immune system and also has antibacterial properties.  2. Milk is the rich source of calcium and is much needed to cure TB fast.  3. Vitamin D to the successful prevention and treatment of TB. Take a high quality COD LIVER OIL capsules.  4. Take THALEESHADI CHURN with OSHAWA KATHAK SINGER added with honey, twice daily.  5. Take CARAVAN IRISH AMELIA two times daily with milk.  6. Take VASARISHTAM 30 ml twice daily."

In addition to that I have insufficient kindney function for many years now with  1.4  creatine as per today Laboratory diagnosis. It varies from time to time - it could change to 1.2, 1.3 creatine but not more than 1.4 now.  I have also high blood pressure measuring 160/80, 140/70, and sometimes 180/65.  I am taking Blopress Plus, Iterium, Zannidip, Doxazosin. and Razilet  tablets for the High blood pressure.  I take Zyloric tablet also for uric acid.  Please advise me the best treatments for these health problems. I would be very  grateful  for your help.  Thanks","Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Your platelet of 44000 is worrisome. Avoid any strenuous work or physical sports as any injury can lead to both internal or external bleeding.2. Heart rate is nothing to worry about as it is dependent on position and activity. If it is not irregular as confirmed by ECG, not to worry. 3. Creatinine is mildly raised, you need to control the blood pressure to avoid further damage to kidney. You will require weight reduction along with moderate exercises. Go for swimming or water aerobics, it will be helpful. Control salt intake and increase fiber in diet. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again."
"I ve been feeling sick a lot lately, but I had the depo-injection 3 months ago, its due again next week,,but every morning I ve woken up feeling sick,and I ve had very strange bowel movements, I ve needed to go to the toilet a lot recently, but what s wrong with me?thanks Lydia","Hi, Abdominal cramps or pain can occur with Demo shots, but diarrhea is unlikely especially after 3 months. Other causes such as gastroenteritis which refers to inflammation of digestive tract. Infections can cause loose stools. Fever, recent travel history should be ruled out. Increase fluid intake and probiotics intake. In case of severe infections, antibiotics should be used. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further."
"Hi, I am a 54 year old female who underwent chemo and radiation thereapy for the treatment of stage 3 Vulvar and stage 1b cervical cancer 1.3 years ago. Recently I have started have severe abdominal cramping, some vomiting when the pain is at it s peak, some diarreah and constipation. This is the second time this has occurred in the last 4 months. My boyfriend has been diagnosed within the past year with severe ulcerative colitis. I have tried some of his meds, but nothing really works except the sterroids. They provide me with a great deal of relief from the pain ( i do not think I could handle it without them), but my condition is not improving and it has been two full weeks, with 9 days on prednisone. 1-3 tablets per day depending on the pain I am experiencing. During my Pet Scan for the cancer my doctor said that he saw evidence of diverticulae. Could this be Diverticulitis instead of Colitis? Would the prednisone help if it were Diverticulitis. p.s. I have seen a doc in the box but have not scheduled with a gastro specialist as they will say I need a colonoscopy which I cannot afford with my lousey insurance policy. I have also recently been experiencing chills and pretty significant weight loss. I am down to 102 lbs and can t really afford to lose anymore. My boyfiend with the colitis has been on several medications for a year and nothing has helped. He doesn t not really experience any pain he only has a feeling of pressure and must go up to 10 or more times a day. We are both at our wits end and do not understand how we both could be experiencing the same type of illness and the same time.","Hi, Thanks for your query. If I see such a patient in my clinic, the first thing I will recommend is that you stop taking prednisone, since steroid abuse is associated with many undesirable side effects. The abdominal cramping, pain & diarrhea/constipation may be related to your diverticular disease. So it is better if you take antibiotics like rifaximin 200 mg thrice daily, antispasmodics and probiotics 5 to 7 days.  In case you symptoms do not get resolved, and you continue to lose weight then I suggest you to consult a physician and get detailed medical examination and colonoscopy done.  Hope this answers your query."
"Hi. Im 17 years old and female, i smoke regulary. I caught a cold a while back now and was coughing up mucus also. After the cold eventually dissapeard the mucus did not. Every morning i cough up mucus when i have the urge to cough and this has being occuring for about a month and half, also when im sat down and i stand up and walk around i feel dizzy and feeling like im going to faint also get tight chests sometimes. Looking forward to hear back from you, thankyou.","Hello are having cough with mucus (phlegm or expectoration) for 1 &1/2 months. Feeling faintness when stand up, dizziness and tight chest. All these symptoms may be due to these reasons, these include:1 Allergic bronchitis, as you are smokers and this causes bronchoconstriction and this produces cough and added infection produces mucus. So due to smoking or any other allergen you developed allergic bronchitis .2 Bronchiectasis, may be the 2nd reason of such symptoms. If the amount of mucus produced is more than 10 ml it may be due to bronchiectasis .3 Tuberculosis, diagnosis can be confirmed by X-ray chest and sputum for an f b and blood for CBC & ESR. As you mentioned that you are also having dizziness and faintness, so these symptoms may be due to anemia, so get in hemoglobin examination. Since you are having these symptoms for long time, this is the best way to consult chest physician and get his opinion. Hope this will help you."
"20 years ago, I thought that had a bad disease and stress of this made my nerves go bad.  I have nausea, dizziness, a spinning sentation and a bad stutter.  I was prescribed amitriptyline by my doctor and I slowly got back to normal.  However, If I miss one day of amitriptyline I will get as sick as I did 20 years ago.  After doing a lot of research, I believe that I have nerve damage in my vestibular system.  Could you give me your opinion of what I have and what I should do?","HIT hank for asking to ChatDoctorIt is not the case as you are thinking, I mean nerve damage ! Not at all it is nerve damage, if your main concern is dizziness, nausea, then it might be vertigo, and may be due to your psychological condition that you have had, your nervous system would be intact, I would advise you to start """"Bitahistine"""" three times in day your problems would subside, even if it does not go away then further investigations will be required, have nice day."

Effect will be the same no matter what dose you take. At this young age of 22 yrs, I feel you are burdening your heart & getting exposed to risks of the side effects. Use during pregnancy is also contraindicated. It does not affect your chances of pregnancy. Maintaining the low weight is even tougher.

"I have a 3 1/2 yr old son who just started preschool last week. Today he has a bad cough, runny nose, and I just noticed Some mild petechiae on his cheeks. He hasn t had a fever but I ve been giving him Motrin. He s only had 2 of his DTaP vaccines. Should I be concerned?",Thanks for putting your query up at Chat Doctor. Probably your little son has a respiratory tract infection. Generally these are caused due to a viral infection and have an allergic component as well. Fever may also occur. The petechial on the cheeks may be due to rupture of small blood vessels just below the skin due to forceful coughing. There is no need to be concerned at the moment. But the condition might require serious attention in case the petechial spots expand or recur elsewhere. I hope that this has not occurred just after the dose of Tap. Do not worry because only two doses have been delivered. Just give the next dose as per schedule. Giving him some antiallergic and steam inhalation is likely to give him some relief. I hope that helps. Feel free to revert in case of further queries if any.

I took  it for 3 cycles i ma ovulating i have 22 MM egg in my Left ovary every time when i had follicular monitering. I still have PCOD.Please let me know what should i do to get pregnent.,"HiP COD is a condition which remains with you. With lifestyle changes and medications its effects can be controlled. Birth control pills are given to regularize cycles. It cannot treat POD. You did not mention what is your BMI. Maintaining a normal BMI is extremely important to increase your chances of pregnancy since you have POD. Therefore, if are obese please reduce weight first. Since your doctor has already started closer for ovulation induction I presume that your fallopian tube patency test, thyroid test and your husbands' semen analysis are normal. It is very good that you are responding to closer. Are you taking injection human chorionic gonadotrophin for ovulation to occur? If you are not taking discuss with your doctor and take it once the follicle reaches mature size. Have intercourse on the day of injection and 48 hours later. To increase your chances of pregnancy you should have regular intercourse at least thrice weekly. If you don't conceive continue induction of ovulation with closer for another three cycles. Later you may need induction of ovulation with hormones. Take one tablet of folic acid daily. Again I repeat please make sure that you maintain normal body weight.

"Hi, I have been suffering with high fever of 102-105 for awhile now. I went to infectious disease doctor and was started on tuberculosis medication although chest x-rays and CT scans showed nothing. My only other symptoms were swollen lymph nodes. At first they thought I had Mono and I took a dose of steroids, that made the fevers stop for a few weeks then it would come back again. I wasnt getting sick the entire time being on the ABT for TB, I stopped taking it about a month ago and I am now having the high fever again. The only thing that seems to take it down is IBU.

The following symptoms are commonly seen with TB involving the lungsEvening rise of temperature, cough with or without sputum, blood in the sputum, fatigue, weight loss, etc. Since you had been diagnosed to have TB lymph nodes (the chest X-ray, CT scan may be normal) the doctor prescribed the medications for a period of at least 12 months which it seems you discontinued in between. Incomplete treatment may result in recurrent infection and development of bacterial resistance to commonly used antibiotics for TB.

In my opinion you should first consult pulmonologist and settle your respiratory issue, only after this you can be fit for surgery. For this you need to admit in hospital.

"Hi, I had a dental abscess , from an upper right tooth , and I had an extraction today. I am having a large (I think) amount of foul, purulent discharge draining from my nose and mouth today. I gather that this is normal, that the abscess found a way to drain. What I am wondering though, is this - should I not be on antibiotics for the infection, as well? I am running on-and-off low-grade temps. They prescribed ibuprofen and acetaminophen for the pain, which I have been alternating every three hours as they told me, as well as soft foods, no sucking or spitting, etc. Any help at all is appreciated.","Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor forum, According to the dental history provided by you, I would like to inform you that when a tooth is associated with an abscess, antibiotics have to be prescribed in order to treat infection. It is pus which is discharging and is responsible for foul odor, once the infection resolves, pus will disappear. Fever is also one of the symptoms associated with infection, currently your medication does not include antibiotics, therefore kindly see your dentist. Perform warm saline rinses(3-4times/day), it will help relief symptoms. Use an antibacterial mouth rinse(twice/day).I hope I answered your query, i wish you good health."

"ello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, As your sister was bitten by confirmed rabid dog for which she was given a shot of antirabies vaccine and the passive immunization after a span of 5 days following the death of the dog.

"Hi, Im 22yrs of age the gynae ive been to diagnosed me with (PSOS) and i have irregular period. He put me on ovral 28 and it did not work for me. however my husband and i would like to have a baby i feel much better ever since i stopped taking the contraceptive. I would like to know if i can fall pregnant because ive been struggling to and ive seen so many doctors and none of them are able to help me","Hi, I think you can get pregnant.  If your periods are regular, be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop. It will increase chances of your pregnancy.  If your periods are irregular, then there can be a problem of ovulation.  So, then you can take some medicines like camphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles' growth by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months."

Asthma is caused due to bronchoconstriction (obstruction of smaller airway passages) which is indicative of Hyper-responsiveness of air passages. Management consists of:1. Stalin+ Aeroflot inhaler-provide symptomatic relief by causing bronchodilator (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs)So, you can use it whenever you are having an acute attack.2. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of asthma.3. Antihistamines like Cetirizine can also be used to provide symptomatic relief.4. Need for anti bionics can arise if there is a secondary infection. But this should be taken only under the guidance of your Physician.5. Also protect yourself from exposure to cold, dust or other allergens. Wish you a good health. Take care."
"culture swab for strep B came back positive three times in the last 3 months. Course of oral antibiotics, course of vaginal antibiotics, probiotocs orally, probiotics vaginally, and no results. Whats the underlying cause for it (if not ph imbalance)?","Hello, Thank you for posting your question to Chat Doctor. The culture for Strep B is done when you have symptoms of infection from strep B. It may normally be in the mucosa, but it doesn't necessarily cause symptoms. The culture will determine from which antibiotic is sensitive to kill the bacteria. Ph's imbalance is the cause of symptom to develop, so for the Strep to grow at the first place. While if you have used so many times antibiotics, the bacteria might have created resistance, lead to a chronic infection which reactivates once in a while. Sometimes low immunity gives more predominance to them to grow. The recommendations are that if the symptoms reactivate more than 6 times/yeah, then the tonsils must be removed. If it's not giving symptoms, no need for a treatment. Hope I answered your question. Let me know if I can help you with any other question. Take care."
"I am writing because I would like to have a confirmation and I want an alternative method to the hinder the progression of MS. My investigations were motivated because I want to stop taking interferon beta and find an alternative method that is based on a natural basis. The long-term study results from last summer that were on interferon-beta, have not had a positive outcome: (MS Society - WWW.WWWW.WW / NY Times: WWW.WWWW.WW . After 4 years of taking Avonex, I still experience serious side effects that have been fought with Celebrex and Ritalin. There are also positive side effects, because I do not get ill as often as I did. After weeks of research, I reached the following conclusions: I understand that a vitamin D deficiency is a component for some diseases and one is MS. Vitamin D increases the interleukin (IL) 10, and simultaneously reduces the IL-6 and IL-17. It retains these two cytokines in balance. An increased IL-6 creates plaques in the brain and IL-17 is responsible for the autoimmune system. Should the IL-17 be too high, it upsets the immune system and it begins to attack its own cells. Interferon-beta is mainly focused on the IL-17 and neglects the IL-6. I also struggle with the herpes virus which is designated as vIL-10, and this fits into the same receptors that are intended for IL-10. Vitamin D is as you know, created by sunshine and after a 30 minute long sunbath in the summer time, you can have up to 20,000 IU in the body. So I think that a 10,000 IU per day cannot cause toxicity . Vitamin D is dependent on vitamin K , zinc, magnesium and boron, to activate it. I would like to take the following orally: - Vitamin D3 - 10,000 IU - Multivitamins per day which includes, among other things: o Vitamin K - 20 - 60 micrograms (mcg) o Zinc - 11 - 15 milligrams (mg) o magnesium - 100 - 120 mg o Boron - 150 mcg - Omega 3 to 1272 mg - Omega 6-928 mg - Omega 9-475 mg o A balance of Omega 3 and 6 is wanted If the above values are too high, or if there is something missing, please let me know? I will continue taking interferon, but I would like to stop it as soon as possible. I am 39, 150lbs, 5 8 and suffer from RemittingRelapsing MS",Hi there ~ I empathize with your situation and that you have been having a tough time with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.  One thing that you may have noticed yourself is that you are focusing too much on labs.  One way to reduce your anxiety is to distract yourself from thinking about your condition too much.  If you start acting like you have no symptoms you probably will end up not having any problems.  I know this is easier said than done but one thing that surely is treated is the anxiety which can make MS symptoms worse.  Consulting a psychiatrist may help with getting you on antianxiety medications and appropriate therapy referral.  I hope this helps. Take care.

hello... I am married.... and I want baby now .. Bt I have ovarian cyst.. I take medicen and that is cured now.Bt I am not getting pregnant ... would u.pls tell me some exercise or any other tips that can help me to conceive as early as possible.,"Hello and thanks for the query, I would first explain to you about the female reproduction and then some ways to recognize when is the best chance of getting pregnant. The female is designed in such a way that every month on about the 14th day of a regular 28 days cycle, one female egg called ovum is released from the ovary, and it goes to the tube and gets fertilized by a male sperm if there has been a recent sexual contact. So if sexual contact occurs during ovulation then only pregnancy will result. Having contact on all other days of the month will not lead to pregnancy. The day of ovulation varies, and it may occur on any day from day 10-20 from the first day of the menses. Hence this is called the fertile period. So for having a maximum chance of getting pregnant a healthy female egg, an open female genital tract [that is no block in tubes, cervix and a normal uterus and its lining] are important. Ovulation can be detected by measuring the body temperature every day before getting up from bed using a special thermometer called a BBT thermometer. After ovulation the female body temperature increases by about 0.5 to 1 degree. Another way is to check the cervical mucus. The mucus is thin and watery during ovulation period. Special ovulation detecting kits and sonography can also be used to detect it. As of now I recommend you try to keep alternate day sexual contact between day 10-20 of the cycle for 6 months. If there is no success, visit an infertility specialist to look for any cause for not getting pregnant. Also start taking b complex and folic acid tablets if you are planning pregnancy as they help prevent birth defects in the baby. Hope this was helpful.

I want to go abroad for work but due to this  i am not able to go. Is there any temporary medicine to remove during xray.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Tuberculosis after treatment produce healing either by fibrosis or calcification or both. These are permanent scar lesions. They are inactive, hence no treatment is required. But they will remain as it is and appear on chest x-ray throughout the life. For your work permit, we need to prove that these lesions are inactive, and you are not suffering from any infectious disease. For this you need to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. CT thorax 2. Bronchoscopic evaluation and BAD (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. CT thorax is far superior then chest x-ray in diagnosis of inactive scar. BAD is much better than sputum to rule out infections like tuberculosis. If both of these are negative then you can argue with visa authority about not having active, infectious disease. And your x-ray spots are old, healed, scar lesions."

Hi I just lost my 9 weeks pregnancy yesterday and Its really hard for us coz we really need to have baby so bad and I want to have pregnancy with twins the next pregnancy do I need to take 100mg clomiphine is that possible for me to have twins the next pregnancy???,"Hi, I am extremely sorry for the mishap and understand your feelings well as I am myself a mother. It is possible to have twins with camphene, but it does not mean that higher doses necessarily mean higher number of babies. It is not possible to predict who will have twins and who will not. The only way to have guaranteed multiple pregnancies is by doing a test tube baby procedure and transferring multiple embryos inside the uterus. So please do not attempt to take higher doses unless recommended by your doctor as very medicine has adverse effects. Also, please take any fertility enhancing medicine only after consulting an infertility specialist as repeated indiscriminate use of these Chat Doctor.  Also, as you have had a miscarriage, it is better to have a single baby as chances of miscarriage are also more in twins. Please do not worry about these issues so much. Consult an infertility specialist if you have problems with conceiving. If the first pregnancy was spontaneous then this is also not needed at this point of time. You may get evaluated for abortions [but we generally recommend it after repeated abortion and not if it was the first time]. Take prenatal vitamins and calcium and follow a healthy sleep and exercise pattern. Also get registered with your doctor early in the next pregnancy and take supportive"

"Hi. I ve come to a dead end with my doctor and would really appreciate some help. Let me give you some background: I am asthmatic, but please don t let that occupy your thoughts too much. In 2006 I had Pneumonia and was admitted to Leeds GI for a week. In 2008 I seperated from my wife and moved into a small flat. I wasn t aware for 12 months that there was a wall of mould behind the chest of draws! I had and continue to have a Chest Infection every 2 months since! My main symptoms are the obvious taste and colour of the infection when it comes up. Also a tightness of my chest, making breathing hard, and leading to coughing and choking, now until dizzy, getting a buzzing sentation and disorientation. My doctor goes in circles unsure what the problem is and why the reoccurance of the chest infections. I have had chest xrays (usually by the time they are booked, the infection is gone and xray clear), and have seen a specialist who jumped to the same conclusion of mismanaging my inhalers. This is not the case. The nurse is happy with my meds and how I use them, and how I up the dosage when I have a chest infection. But because the doctor is at a loss, I only get amoxicillen and steroids (the latter are bad for me long term). All I do is go in circles, The chest infections take two courses of antibiotics, and still they do not make me completely better. The infections remain underlying, and the next cold I catch ultimately turns into the next chest infection. This has been my life for over 6 years now, and only since the initial Phenmonia. As a child I had a very weak chest. My mother would walk me to nursery only for me to get there and need to go home as my chest was so tight. I grew out of this with the help of inhalers, and my asthma wasn t much of a problem growing up. These chest infections have only become so frequent since the Phemonia in 2006. I am now at a stage where I feel desperate for someone with fresh eyes and an open mind to look into this, and not just make the wrong assumptions that I don t eat well enough, or know how to take my inhalers... I am 33 (DOB 25/07/80) and know in my heart that if this is allowed to continue without adequate treatment, I face an early death when my chest is older and even weaker. I don t think I can add much more; only that I do take my inhalers correctly, and to make you aware that ALWAYS when I have a chest infection and my chest is tight and breathing difficult, the inhalers DO NOT relieve my chest in any way, but it does feel like it is Asthma - but clearly it isn t. Also when I take a test and breathe into the measure thing to see my lung capacity, it is always remarkably high, which also throws the doctor. With a chest infection I will still score 600 plus. Your help is desperately appreciated. Kind regards, Jamie M Hinton, Reading, Berks.",It looks like you have pulmonary aspergilli.

"Hi. I have a pain that I think starts in my knee and goes up my thigh. It is a dull, gradual ache that I cannot pinpoint. I was taking statins a few months ago and stopped because I thought it was affecting my muscles. I notice it most sitting, driving or going to sleep. There is no comfortable position. I felt the statins affected my thigh muscles, but this feels a little different, almost like bone aches.","Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor ! Your symptoms could be related to a pinched nerve or a bulging disk in the lumbar region (compressing the sciatic nerve). Coming to this point, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a physical exam and some tests: -a nerve conduction study to exclude a pinched nerve or neuropathy- a lumbar spine X-ray study (a lumbar spine CT scan may be needed). Some blood lab tests (complete blood count, PCR, Sedimentation rate, blood electrolytes, vitamin D levels) are necessary too. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Best wishes,"
"My husband was a dialysis patient. He complained of back pain and laid down with a heat pad on his back. A couple hours later, He died in his sleep and there was vomit.

I am sad to hear about your husbands demise. Please accept my condolences. The most common reason for death in dialysis patients is cardiovascular (Heart attack, Strokes, heart rhythm problems, etc.). One of the conditions which I think is most likely in your husbands' case is Dissecting Aortic Aneurysm which can cause back pain and many a time can be life-threatening. A myocardial infarction (heart attack) is always very high on the list of probabilities off course. Unlikely he died of a heart attack. Hope this helps. Kind regards. RB"

The episodes are brief & lasting few seconds to a minute. The more recent episodes could be seizures or syncope. The prolonged period of unresponsiveness, lack of memory for the previous nights events and other accompanying symptoms raises the possibility of seizures. Visit a neurologist who will be able to perform an EEG, Brain imaging & other tests which can help in confirming the diagnosis. A cardiac evaluation for any cause of blackouts is also necessary.

I would suggest you to go to your family physician and take medicines if advised by him before it gets worse. Take care."

"Hi, about a week ago (after a workout) i have begun to have quite bad sensitivity issues to the right (as I see it) of my stomach and my back.

I hear you & it does seem you have an issue with an iatrogenic infection caused by overzealous use of the wives :) On a serious note, you need to be seen by a physician & prescribed an appropriate antibiotics & anti-inflammatory agent that will depend on your body weight & will require a prescription! Do try to do a light steaming followed by splashing cold water on the region to help release the pus that seems locked in. This will help clear your sinuses in addition. Swelling in the midline of the face needs to be taken care of soon as it was what used to be taught to us as students as being the dangerous area of the face because of its proximity to the sinuses higher up & the chances of what we call a cavernous sinus thrombosis...hence the need for immediate intervention with an antibiotic.

A series of epidural injections is not the recommended treatment for your problem. Initial treatment would include medications (such as pregabalin or gabapentin) and physiotherapy (neck exercises, IT, ultrasound, traction, etc.).

"HELLO Dr, I am having this nerve twitches all over my body especially on my 2 legs for the past one month now.Though it has subsided, but it still occurs and worries me a great deal. I also feel that the vein on the left side of my neck has expanded. It has also subsided but refused to go completely. When I feel it with my hand , I do not feel anything or any form of pain, but the feel of the expansion occurs at intervals. Pls advice. Thanks Bede.","Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The most common cause for muscle twitching on your legs could be a condition called as benign articulations. This is not a serious condition, and would subside on its own. However, you should watch for muscle wasting (thinning of muscles) and weakness, when you would need to see a neurologist to exclude other conditions such as ALS. Bulging neck vein is normal and in the absence of symptoms (such as breathlessness), there is no need to worry. I hope it helps. Please get back if you require any additional information.

"Hi there, I got scratched in the face by a large parrot. The wound wasnt too deep, and I was able to stop the bleeding quite easily. I cleaned it and used some Bactine, and Polysporin.  There is only mild swelling.  My question is, do I meex a tetanus shot (I havent had one in over 10 years).  Im guessing not, but thought it best to check.  Isabelle","Hi there thanks for asking this on Chat Doctor, no need to worry you don't need a tetanus injection for parrot scratch. Its usually given wounds where you are exposed dirt or soil because the bacteria causing tetanus is found there. On the other hand since you are saying a parrot scratched you there may a chance of you getting a disease called psittacosis. If you develop symptoms like fever, joint pain, difficulty in breathing, diarrhoea you consult with a nearby physician. The treatment is a course of antibiotic like doxycycline or chloramphenicol."

I have two abcess teeth one with wisdom tooth growing threw my neck and back is hurting so bad it hurts my back to swallow on medrol flexril Tylenol naproxin and amoxycillin for that but woke up seveir chest pain and pressure feels like someone is sitting on my heart with shooting electrifying pain into neck jaw and arm all on left side feel light headed short of breath nausea,"Hi. Thanks for the query. It looks like Peritonitis that occurs due to infection below the gum flap and the wisdom tooth. Due to infection there is pus formation leading to abscess formation. The medication you are advised is appropriate, along with it, you can also do warm saline gargles and antiseptic mouthwash gargles. The other symptoms like severe chest pain and pressure feel like someone is sitting on my heart with shooting electrifying pain into neck jaw and arm all on left side feel light-headed short of breath nausea can either be a side effect of medication or acid reflux or any cardiac problem. So my suggestion is to immediately consult an Emergency room and get evaluated, and a clinical examination should be done so that appropriate treatment can be done. Hope this helps. Regards."
Hello. I have recently had an abscess and been prescribed 2 lots of antibiotics to help clear the infection and I stopped taking them yesterday and today my left cheek is sore and swollen again I cant get to a dentist until Thursday at the earliest im going to go see my gp tomorrow and see if they can give me some more antibiotics. What would you suggest? . Thanks.,"Hello, Thank you for consulting with Chat Doctor. As you are mentioning that you were having an abscess in the tooth, and you were prescribed antibiotics now after antibiotics again swelling has started, it looks like that the infection is still present there. Actually when there is infection is present in the tooth a root canal treatment should be started with antibiotics which will help in healing, only antibiotics can not solve the problem. So you have to visit your dentist to get started with root canal treatment. Hope it will help you."
"Hi, I have a friend who has been smoking put for maybe two years. he is also depressed. He had a bad trip last summer where he could not remember what had happened. He kept saying he was really scared and seemed really anxious. A couple of days ago he called me and days he had to talk to me in person about something important. He showed up at my house hyperventilating, anxious , and almost crying. After a while he started to just state out into space not responding to anything. Then he would try to stand up but couldn t. He was on the verge of fainting a few times. He said he hadn t eaten in the days but didn t want eat. He then started dating that he felt that he was gonna die, that he felt it, and those around him were in danger. He kept reaching got his razor blade saying that he had to die and that he was sorry. He then got a phone ca ll and after he hung up and seemed more calm but days he might hurt himself if left alone and he left. What happened?","Hello He is showing symptoms of anxiety, restlessness, emotional turmoil, crying spells. He is smoking pot for two years. These features are common in some susceptible individuals who smoke pot. Also, as you have mentioned that he felt he would die, or he felt that those around him are in danger. He is showing bizarre behaviors. He is also suicidal. These are psychotic features seen with pot or cannabis. If not stopped at this state he may land up in some psychotic disorder. I will advise you to take him to a good psychiatrist for treatment of anxiety. Motivate him to stop taking cannabis. For immediate relaxation medicines like Mizoram, Clonazepam etc. can be used in consultation of psychiatrist. Thanks"
"I had an episode of rapid heartbeat two weeks ago, my heart dr. did several tests and sent me home with a beta blocker to take every day, and also i am wearing a heart monitor...since i have been wearing the heart monitor, (one week 1/2) i noticed a small area on my right collarbone that looked a little puffy so i felt it and it feels like a small marble moving around...my dr. looked at it and put me on antibiotics...i had a chest xray and chest c/t scan at the hospital march 2nd...my dr. was going to do an xray, but after i told him i had one march 2nd he said ok then he doesnt need to do another one...from what i am reading it sounds like lumps/marbles could be cancerous and i  am extremely scared now...what do you think it most likely is? i was sick in feb. with congestion/cold symptoms???","Hello, In my opinion, you have a collar bone boil with the infection for which your doctor started antibiotics. CT and x-ray chest bothered you much, and you started worrying about the possibility of cancerous lumps in your collarbone area. By no means, this lump or collar formation is cancerous and is due to the infected boil on the collar bone area. So just forget it as antibiotics would take care of it. Cold and congestion are part of the seasonal illness and should not worry you much. So keep cool. Consult your emergency room, surgeon and physician, if need be, who would treat it accordingly. So don't build up wrong concepts and create more psychic complications in you which would increase risks and costs to you. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
My son just had his braces removed yesterday and is now wearing Hawley retainers on both his upper and lower teeth.He has history a 3 month of vomiting due to delayed gastric emptying syndrome and is take Zantac 150mg BID and EES 400m g BID for this problem. Since he starting wearing his retainers last night he has had an increase in vomiting due to the retainers stimulating his gag reflex.  Is there anything he can do to help this problem?,"Hello, I am sorry to hear of this difficulty with the retainers. Having something on the roof of the mouth can take getting used to and stimulates salivary flow. There is a breaking in period. Rinsing with an astringent mouth wash may reduce the sensation. The extent of the retainer reaching to the back of the mouth should be adjusted as to reduce size and keep as thin as possible. There are other designs for retainers that do not sit on the roof of the mouth. An option may be one that sits on the teeth with clear acrylic. The clear retainer is often preferred by patients. Many orthodontists prefer the Hawley type on upper teeth especially if the upper jaw has been expanded. Please discuss this with your orthodontist. There may be some longer term options for a bonded retainer if the vomiting cannot be controlled. You do not want to have the teeth move after completing orthodontic treatment for lack of wearing a retainer. Thank you for your inquiry. I hope this information is helpful, so your son can enjoy having his braces off and smile to show off his straight teeth."

i had an ablation for multifocal pathways psvt.After 11 months it  started again and i have been to the er 4 times for cardioversion with adenosine.I w as on dilzem 180.Now the doctor has added cordarone 400mg .He feels another ablation will not help.I know how toxic cordarone can be.Can  I have my av node ablated and be fitted with a permanent pacemaker? What are your suggestions? Thank you for hearing me out,"Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should first get done repeat EP (electron physiological) study to determine the accessory pathways. If this is same as previously as no need for ablation and pacemaker. Cordon is good Chat Doctor.  And don't worry much about side effects. These side effects can be easily managed. If your EP study is worse than the previous study, you need AV node ablation and pacemaker. So first get done fresh EP study and then decide future plan of treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."
"My mother has been diabetic since 1987. Her age is 70 years and Weight 55 Kgs. As of now she is on insulin shots 26 Unit in night and 45 Units in morning along with Glycomate GP 2 Forte 1 tb in morning. The Blodd is well under control since last 7-8 months after induction of insulin. THe last reading taken was 60 in fasting and 114 in PP. The local Dr has advised to reduce the night dosage to 22 units and keep the morning dosage same.  Recently she started taking Blood Pressure medicine since las 7-8 months. Even the BP is under control. She is taking Telminorm AM once daily in morning. Yesterday I took the reading of BP and found that it was 131/60 with pulse rate as 105. This seems to be a matter of concern to me. After consultation with local Dr, she has been advised to take Telminorm 80 instead of Telminorm AM.My question is that is Telminorm 80 having more power than Telminorm AM ? I am of the opinion that some lower dosage medicine shd be prescribed.","Hello and welcome to Ask a Doctor service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I think 131/60 BP Is fine, It's not too elevated and the change of medicine with not help. Although her pulse rate is elevated and change will not reduce pulse rate also. Regarding your question, Elinor Am has two BP medicine and Elinor 80 has only one component, so potency strength wise there is not much difference. My advice is just monitor the resting BP and pulse rate and if BP goes above 140/90 then increasing the medicine would be needed. Also pulse rate is persistently high, then get her thyroid and hemoglobin tested and beta blocker medicine will be needed. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

"Hello, My name is Waseem, am 27 yrs old i was suffereing from irregular heart beat( palpitation ), i concern a cardiologist he made check up and made some tests like (2d echo, blood test so on) then conform that its a muscle pain, later i met with a general physician he suggested me to use nexito plus for two months.

Now i would like to know whether i continue with nexito plus or any alternative remedy to overcome my anxiety and depression. Thannk you.","Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I understand your concern and would explain that palpitations and anxiety are closely related. Your symptoms seem to be related to anxiety and depression. Your heart seems to be in optimal conditions (based on your performed cardiac tests)Next plus is a benzodiazepine, which can be used for a long term therapy (contrary to other benzodiazepines). I would recommend consulting with a psychiatrist, which is a specialist in the field of depression and anxiety. He could help you manage these symptoms better. Psychotherapy could be helpful in your situation. Instead of Next plus, you should discuss with the psychiatrist the possibility of starting an antidepressant (like SSRI, etc), which are very effective against anxiety and depression. Yoga, recreational sport activities are also very effective too. I would also advise avoiding caffeine intake, which is known to trigger anxiety. Hope to have been of help! Best regards,"

Height:5 5 Weight 175pounds Age:46 Female. I have been experiencing depression and anxiety for more than 5 years. None of the anti depression medications worked for me. Anti anxiety medications I was prescribed made me drowsy so I can;t take them regularly and I don t know why I get more depressed while on anti anxiety medications. The problem that is seriously affecting me at the moment is sleep. I can t stay sleep I wake up several times in the middle of the night. Medications such as Ambien or over the counter stuff do not help. I have given up discussing this with my doctor since we have been running out of options with anti depressants. anti anxiety and sleeping aides according to her. Any advise on what to do or any suggestions I can discuss with my doctor? Thanks.,"Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  The suggestion any doctor gives here is, provide all the above information to the psychiatrist you are consulting. Work closely with him and he knows your problems. He should be able to provide solutions to your problems. Exercise or work plays a major part in sleep. If you work more and exercise rigorously, you shall get sleep. Otherwise, also you sleep. But the sleep may not be fulfilling or satisfactory because of the effect of the medications you are having and the lethargy you are experiencing. Do talk to your psychiatrist. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this website. Make sure that you include every minute details possible.

So no need to worry this early. If ovulation kit was positive around 3 weeks after the period, then probably you will have your periods after 5 weeks of previous period. Because period occurs exactly 14 days after ovulation. So if you ovulated after 3 weeks, still there is time. You may recheck for pregnancy test after 2 weeks if you don't get your period.  Some harmony with Chat Doctor. Best of luck and take care. Hope it helps you."

"My mother was told she had non Hodgkin lymphoma, stage 2. She has had 11 radiation treatments of the 18 she was told that she needed. She is having headaches on the right side of her head for the last three to four days, and she started having double-vision yesterday. She was told today that she needed another round of 18 treatments. She is already tired and sick from the treatments, and being disabled, and living with my sister, has been very hard on her. Her calcium levels have been going high lately, but better the last two weeks. What should be done for her? My sister is taking her to her eye doctor Wednesday. Is the treatments causing the headaches and double vision? Should she do the second round of 18 treatments? What do we need to discuss with her doctors and which ones?","Hi, Thanks for writing in. Radiation is a type of energy that is invisible. It is focused high energy on areas affected by cancer and destroys cancer cells. Even after taking precautions, it is possible that radiation therapy might cause short term and long term side effects on the optic pathway. This is the path through which the nerves carry information about our visual surroundings. Headaches and double vision might be related to the lymphoma itself or a side effect of radiation treatment. She should discuss her symptoms with the ophthalmologist and her radiation oncologist to know the probable cause of her symptoms. If it is a side effect on the visual pathway then radiation therapy might have to be planned again such that the side effects are reduced. If it is due to the cancer itself then the treatment might require modification to achieve better response. Please do not worry."
Me and my boyfriend had sex four days after my period and he did not do the withdrawal so I decided to take oral contraceptive.

If so, you are protected from the pregnancy due to this act. Post-coital emergency contraceptive pills are quite reliable for contraception. These pills have some after effects:1. Few days after the consumption of these pills, some bleeding occurs. This does not require any medical attention as it is normal. You are experiencing this type of bleeding. It is not an issue of concern. 2. The following periods may get delayed by few days up to a week or so. If so happens, please have no stress. I hope this resolves your query.

"age 10 yrs,wt 27kgs my son is suffering from asthma since past 6yrs. we tried all the possible medications.since my husbands job is transferable,some places suit him and some doesnt. at present he is on seroflo and montek lc(for 3 months). the day i avoid him montek, next day he feels breathless.i am worried since long term dosage of steroids might have some or the sideeffects.is there any other alternative?","Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Were I treating your son, I would continue same treatment while slowly attempting to reduce medications gradually over a few months. As per my opinion, Monte and Aeroflot are optimum for him if discontinuation of them causes symptoms to him.2. I would suggest him allergy testing for common air-borne substances such as house dust mites, molds, pollen, insect proteins, pet dander, etc. This will help you identify the substances causing allergies to him as well as to know the measures to avoid them.3. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe him allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms. Immunotherapy is the only proven measures that reduce medications requirements in persistent asthma patients.4. In general, I would suggest your son to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.5. Regular breathing exercises and a healthy diet will also help him in a long run by improving his lung capacity and immunity respectively. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish your son the best of the health ahead. Thank you & Regards."

Chronic cough could be allergic or infective in etiology. Ingestion of antibiotics and antiallergic medication is not effective if you have taken without confirm diagnosis .you should first find out the cause of cough and then treat accordingly.

All this test will help you to decide treatment plan as there are different treatment protocol for different condition. You can consult a respiratory and chest physician for complete evaluation of case .hope it will help you"
"Hi, i am on the Contreceptive pill but forgot to take one, carried on as normal and then had an upset stomach a week later, and carried on taking my pill for another 3 days until my pill free week. i didnt have another pack to carry on with and didnt expect having sex any time soon. i ended up having sex but used a condom which later had spilt. after 28 hours i went for the morning after pill. now i am due on my period and i am 2 days late. im reallly worried that i am pregnant.","Hello, and I hope I can help you today. The morning after pill is 90 percent effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse.  So, regardless of what happened with your pill taking before your pill-free week, the morning-after pill should still be effective. Many women have a delayed period after taking the morning-after pill as a side effect, but the possibility of pregnancy still exists if you are late, so you should perform a urine pregnancy test just in case.  If it has not been 2 weeks yet since your unprotected encounter, it may be too early to have a positive pregnancy test, so I would repeat it in a week if that is the case. In addition, many women have an irregular period or skip entirely after they stop the pill. If you are not pregnant, you can start a new pack of pills as soon as you get them, but just use a condom as a backup for the first two weeks.

My son is 7 yrs old he was suffering from cold and fever from last 4 days so I gave him crocin and clamp and montek lc kid.now he doesnt have fever from last 2 days but today he is complaining of pain in both his legs in his calf when he walks and it I quite painfull now what is the reason?,"Hi... Pain in the legs could be due to inflammation of the calf muscles due to viral illness and fever. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics (Clamp) at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Regards -"

After only 5 doses, the white coating on my tongue has completely disappeared and  I have energy back as well, but there is still some burning sensation on my tongue and roof of the mouth.  I am not sure how the infection was contracted- perhaps a possible infected toothbrush that I used consistently for 5 days or so.

For conforming urinary infection you should do a urine routine test first. If puss cells are more there is sign of infection and can start on antibiotic empirically.

Facial spasms can be controlled either by oral medications / Botox injections/ Surgical intervention(if it is due to Facial nerve compression). Although you have to take regular medications or repeat Botox injections at regular intervals(maybe once every 3 myths), under your neurosurgeons' guidance it will temporarily relieve your problem. Surgical intervention will be finalized only by your neurologist/ neurosurgeon after monitoring your response to oral Chat Doctor.  Every problem has a solution. So Never Ever give up and have positive thoughts. Consult a neurosurgeon in your area for confirmation of your diagnosis and early intervention. Take care :-)."

It was a reddish rash before and now the redness has gone but the bump can be felt. He does not seem to have any pain or irritation.

A family member is battling a staph infection resulting from a knee surgery. Her white blood cell count was extremely elevated and her hemoglobin count was 7.2. She had to receive a blood transfusion last night due to the low blood count and the doctors are telling her that she is on the road to recovery and will be feeling better after the transfusion. My concern is that the infection is going septic if her hemoglobin is dropping like this. . . what are your thoughts?,"Hi and thanks for the query, Remember surgery on its own was an invasive procedure and some blood was raised during the process. Severe infection leads to falls in hemoglobin levels. However, in this case, if the infection is not well controlled and the septicemia continues, there is a risk of the hemoglobin levels continuing to fall. Blood cultures and sensitivity tests are very important in this case. Otherwise, other Chat Doctor. Having advice too from an infectiologist might be of help. Proper management of the wounds and surgical followup and nursing too an integral aspect in the management plan. Thanks and best regards, Luchuo, MD."

Yes, anemia can cause shaking of hands, palpitations etc. Arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) can also cause palpitations with shaking of hands. So better to first get done ECG, 2d echo and Holder monitoring (24 hour continuous monitoring of ECG). If all these are normal then no need to worry about arrhythmia or other heart diseases.

Don't worry, you will be alright, but first rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."

"Doctor, I herewith attached my wife s follicular scan Reports.As per the first Scan Report she has poly syst ovaries.As per the second Scan Report after taking Medicines And Injuctions,the follicle is in larger size.Also showing utreus as subseptate.Is there any chance for pregnancy and Ovulation?What is subseptate utreus?Please explain. Regards Justine George","Hi dear, Polycystic ovaries and substitute uterus bot causes problem in conceiving. However, if treated correctly, the chances of pregnancy are good. Polycystic ovaries hampers with ovulation and can be managed medically and if required a laparoscopic treatment may be needed. Subseptate uterus is a condition where the uterine cavity is partially divided into two halves by a septum or a division. This hampers not with conception but implantation of fetus and can result in repeated abortions. It requires surgical management where the septum has to be removed. Your wife should be treated for the two before trying for conception. In modern era and good treatment options the chances of your wife getting pregnant is pretty good. All the best"
"A PET exam result six months ago was recurrent cancer in the neck near the right side of my collarbone. I had had thyroid cancer that had been surgically treated removing thyroid totally three years ago. This week ultrasonic diagnosis confirmed the PET result.

A liver lesion post breast cancer treatment can be a source of worry. The only way to confirm whether it is metastatic or not is to get a PET scan or a biopsy of the lesion.

This particular bacteria can sometimes be difficult to treat and may be resistant to some antibiotics used. In addition, the antibiotics often have to be used for a prolonged period for an effective response. The urinary tract infection itself can cause the abdominal pain that you are experiencing.

He or she may ask for another sample of urine to send to the lab and depending on your physical findings suggest and ultrasound to assess the kidneys. This would determine if there are any other issues like a kidney stone. I hope this helps"

But i get pregnent soon can i use Gonadotropin injection is it adviceable please guide me how to use the injection.even though we tred folliovia 75 injection but failled","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Yes. You can try Gonadotropin injection for infertility. Because you have already tried and failed by using UROFOLLITROPHIN (follows). You can also try Camphene In women who do not ovulate, camphene, rather than gonadotropin, is often recommended as an initial treatment. The advantages of camphene compared to gonadotropin include 1. Ease of oral administration2. Fewer side effects3. Lower cost (of the medication itself, as well as the monitoring)4. Lower risk of multiple pregnancies, and reduced time commitment (related to monitoring during treatment). But Gonadotropin is given by injection. Early in the menstrual cycle, FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) is given by injection 12 days for maturation of follicles. Once the follicle is matured as seen by serial ultrasound. One dose of human chorionic gonadotropin (Chat Doctor) will be given to stimulate ovulation. Side effects are more common and more serious with gonadotropin treatment. Please consider Camphene and compare both. Consult with your Gynecologist regarding this for further management of your infertility. Hope this helps. Please reply for further queries. Wishing you good health."
i am a 16 year old male. I have been taking a drug called anafranil for ocd. I have been taking it for about a month. every week the dosage was increased. i am now trying to get off the drug by decreasing the dosage until i dont take it at all. what i have become aware of is that i have had trouble reaching orgasm. im afraid that this is permanent or that if it does get better that i will still be affected in some small way. Please tell me if it will get better and how much better.,"Hi there ~ If your problem is the ability to not get orgasm and feel like that is related to unafraid it might be wise to go off of the medication.  However, I assure you that you will get better and reach orgasm when you stop taking the medication.  I however feel like there is more to the story than just the medication.

"Hello, i am currently getting treated for low b12 levels which 3 weeks ago it stood at 72, i attended the doctors to be told this and my doctor was going to contact the haematologist in order to see the course of action, she believed it was pernicioys anaemia, however the following day on the friday, i fainted and ended up in an emergency appointment which i began the b12 injections, i have finished my 6 injections within two weeks and now im not sure if i attend the doctor again? Do i need to, does she need to test if its working? Because i would like to know if its 100% pernicious anaemia. Please help, would it be advisable to book an appointment to see where i go from now after 6 injections?","Hello, thanks for the query.  As you yourself knows that B 12 is water-soluble vitamin, and it usually not forms in our intestine so extra supplements are necessary. Cyanocobalamine is the name of this B 12 and plenty of amounts is found in cheese, meat,eggs, fish, dairy products. In your case it might happen that you have simple anemia in which Hemoglobin level is usually less than 7-8 GMS.  Pernicious anemia is a disease due to deficiency of B 12, but hematologist will first firm whether it is pernicious or other form of anemia, so the best way is to approach hematologist.

"I was diagnosed with Wegeners disease 2 weeks ago after being in remission for about 4 months.

Is there a different med to take in its place? I read all the side effects for Vatican and Rituxan.  Also, what are granulomas?? Should I be havinga second opinion as far as these drugs that have been prescribed.  I am 59 years old and the anca is 1_640.Thank you","Hello there! 4 months of remission followed by recurrence shows you were not compliant with Ottoman and steroids and Rituxan. Did u take all 4 doses weekly for a month of rituximab? What every past is past now that you have been started on these three meds I recommend taking them as prescribed and chances are your disease will go back to remission 90- 95 %. It would have been better if you had stated the stage of the disease whether it is Localized, early symptomatic, generalized, or severe, or refractory. We call the disease severe when the creatinine levels rise more than 5.6 and generalized when a vital organ like kidney etc. are involved. .minimize your exposure to ill contacts as you are immunosuppressed. And your prednisone issue yes you can replace it with methyl prednisone IV 0.5 mg /kg/day.there are some other treatment addition too for the comorbidities like deadly pneumonitis pneumonia a complication of immunosuppression. For that Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole thrice a day to be used for at lest six months after last dose of rituximab. And Plasma exchange is also used it the disease is severe that is great level >5.6 and disease is deteriorating. And METHOTREXATE can also be used if the disease is localized or less severe 20-25 mg per week, but it takes longer to reach remission with it.Ivies intravenous immunoglobulins, mycophenolate moieties (2g/day), evanescent, infliximab, 15-de oxyspergualin, antithrombocyte globulin, alemtuzumabs, abatements and stem cell transplants are some other treatment option but costly .let sum arise To induce remission you needcyclophosphamiderituximabPneumocystic TMP-SMZ prophylaxis glucocorticoidsmethotrexate (if local)To maintain remission you will needAzathioprinemethotrexate leflunamideglucocorticoidsI wish you good luck and get well soon.

Should I take emegency contraceptives?","Hello and Welcome to Ask A Doctor service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. As sometimes pre-ejaculatory fluid can contain spermatozoa we can not completely exclude the possibility of pregnancy. PCs can also cause delay in periods. But better to undergo urine pregnancy test once. If the result is positive, you may need to consult your gynecologist and undergo ultrasound to confirm intrauterine sac and gestational age. Then depending on that you can go for medical termination of pregnancy. If test gives negative result, you can wait one more week for the onset of periods. Hope I have answered your query.

"the right side of my scrotum is red, inflamed and oozing a clear, sticky and smelly liquid.the liquid goes from clear to sticky clear, then to crust. the doctor told me it s contact fibrosis and gave me a fungal/cordizone cream mixed with a steroid to get rid of it and told me to keep the area clean and dry. . . after 4 days it was gone ...yet,it came back 3 weeks later worst than ever.before it was just sore in the effected area ...now it itches and is more sore than before and is spreading to surrounding areas. just yesterday under my scrotum started itching at night...and after rubing it to releive the itch = the skin there is oozing and sore now as well. Is this contact fibrosis like the doctor said? Is it jock itch? Hives? since it started in the right pit area of the scrotum it might be chafing? or is it something worst like scabies cause of the crusting of the liquid etc. what do you think this is? and how am I suposed to keep an area dry that is oozing clear liquid? any herbal remedies for this? cause i think it has gotten more sensitive in that area since i used the cordizone cream on it.","Hi, From history it seems that you might be having fungal infection and now super added with bacterial infection causing lots of problems.

I am 31 and my husband is 35 and we are currently planning on doing IVF for our first baby. I am closely monitoring my diet and wanted to know if i can continue to drink coffee and tea everyday ? 1 cup of coffee in the morning and 1 -2 cups of tea in the evening. Also my husband might be leaving back to US and I wanted to know if freezing sperms is as good as a fresh sample ?,"Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. You can take one cup of tea or coffee daily. That won't cause any problem for your fertility treatment.  Don't Chat Doctor.  That means mixing more coffee powder in half glass milk. Excess caffeine in coffee is harmful and know to cause infertility. That is 9 to 10 cups of coffee daily and concentrated one. Yes frozen sperms are as good as fresh sperms. Nowadays, every IVF centers froze ovum and sperms to avoid multiple removal. It is safe. Don't worry. Be stress-free. Hope I have been helpful. Regards"
My partner is 48 and is menopausal. She is on HRT and has stopped taking the pill. She is quite convinced that she cannot conceive naturally anymore and that we don t need contraception. I am not so sure. As our children are grown up and we don t need to start again what is the likelihood of a natural conception?,"Hi, I guess you concern is about chances of getting pregnant at the age of 48 yrs, that is menopausal stage. Firstly I want to discuss the menopause- it means permanent cessation of menstruation at the end of reproductive life (reproductive life is between 15-45 yrs age group, during which maximum chances of getting pregnancy occurs). So once menses stopped, there is no chance of getting conceive naturally. That means after getting menopause there is 0% chances of getting conceive naturally. So DON'T WORRY, RELAX. Secondly you told me that your partner is on HRT (hormone replacement therapy) and has stopped taking pills. After the menopause there is no need of contraceptive pills (birth spacing pills). So RELAX. Your partner don't need the extra burden of these pills. But you have not told me that which medicines your partner took under HRT, so I can't comment on this. With the above information you can try out my suggestions:1. RELAX, DON'T WORRY, NO NEED TO TAKE TENSION. Your partner is on the safe side.2.  You told me that your partner is taking HRT. In my suggestion you can continue it but not for more than 3-5 yrs, because it may cause some harmful effects to your partners body. For that I would like to suggest you to visit your treating doctor or nearby gynecologist for your HRT related pros and cons. Lastly again I want to tell you that after menopause there is no chance of getting pregnant. So live the life with your child Chat Doctor. I hope this information is useful, informative and helpful for you. Let me know if I can assist you further."
I just saw something on the local king 5 news that EPO was a proven assist for people like me with very low Anemia problems (Hematocrit @ 25). I was also diagnose Myeloma in 2012 and am now in remission. May problem is I just have no energy to complete any projects etc. Would the E EPO help my energy level? George Bennett,"Hi there while EPO helps build up your hemoglobin level(blood level)we can't tell you for sure that it will increase your energy level. Your fatigue or tiredness may be due to more than one thing considering that you had myeloma, and you are in remission. I suggest you see your doctor to determine the possible reasons why you can be tired and if anemia is one of them the traditional treatment is to treat the cause of it. If the cause of anemia is not related to a kidney dysfunction then EPO will not help you."

I strongly recommend that you see both a medical doctor and a qualified mental health professional and that both these individuals communicate their findings to each other.

Certain kinds of birth defects, called neural tube defects, which can cause malformations of the brain and spinal cord can be associated with a lack of folic acid. So we generally recommend that all women planning pregnancy take as least 400 mg of folic acid daily, so they are taking it from the moment of conception. So I agree with your doctor that you should take the vitamin supplement as ordered, as it will help you have a healthy pregnancy. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Take care,"

"Son aged 3 has just been prescribed penicillin for tonsilitis.  He has had one dose and then gone to bed as normal.  However he has since woken up 3 times in 4 hours in a cold sweat and has just had a nose bleed.  Is such a reaction normal, unrelated or cause for concern (I note that the tonsiltis had been causing cold sweats before but not as often)","Thanks for asking. I have gone through your question and I understand your concern.  Your son who is 3 years old has suffered with tonsillitis as being treated with penicillin. As you said, and he woke up 3 times in 4 hours with cold sweat and nose bleed, you are worried.  There are no relation between cold sweat and the penicillin sometimes its due to fever which is coming down. In my opinion is no case to worry.continue the treatment, wish you healthy family thank you"
"I have been prescribed Augmentin for a baterial infection from a flea bit here in india, the infection has gone down, but i have finished the last of my course of tablets and it is still there, do i need another course, or will it coontinue to fight the infection?I am 40 yrs old, 95kg,male","HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor The symptoms of infection should have resolved-fever, increased warmth in the area, redness, swelling, discharge, pain these symptoms are still present then you may need another course of antibiotics.

My mother is 83 yrs old. No history of blood pressure except a little high sometimes for the last couple of years She has to go for a cataract operation soon and her blood pressure has suddenly shot up But it was fluctuating. Doctor adviced Stamlo 5 twice daily until the operation. But should we give her this medicine even if the pressure goes back to near normal? Her pulse is around 90.,"Hi !  Thank you for posting your question here. I would say that when the blood pressure it's more than 140:90 , should consider high blood pressure and need to take care especially after having it for a long time, cause will affect the heart and blood vessels. Stamlo (amlodipine) is a good Chat Doctor. The thing is that amlodipine can cause low blood pressure and fast heart data (tachycardia more than 100 heart beat / minute ). So measure your grandmother blood pressure, heart beat every day, also if she has swollen legs. If she has call the doctor he will low the dosage to 5 mg once a day, or change the medication according to the side effect.Also, should check the cholesterol level, heart and kidney condition. Wish these help. If you have any other questions please feel free to ask me"
"Evening!I just used some Rembrandt peroxide mouth wash. I noticed slight discomfort on the inside of my lower lip but figured I might have burned myself eating. However, when I ejected the rinse after a minute, I noticed white/ivory coloured left-behinds. Id say they looked rather similar to scabs and did not come off. Its been about five to ten minuted and it disappeared again, nothing left to feel, no pain just discomfort while rinsing and a few minutes right after.I applied a bit of rinse to the same area with a cotton swab again and the same outcome, white scab-like features, feels a bit rough to my tongue, same formation as before.What do you suppose that is/was?","Hello and welcome, Rembrandt peroxide mouthwash contain shy Chat Doctor. This resulted in scabs which is non-scrapable. Please discontinue the use of peroxide mouth rinses since your mucosa is allergic to this content. Rinse mouth frequently using warm saline or Betadine solution. Apply McCoppin gel on the affected area. Rinse mouth after every meal. Please do not scrape the area using fingers. Avoid intake of hot/spicy foods. Hope this helps."
"My 24 year old daughter has begun her 5th year in remission for AML.  She has a very good prognosis.  She had 13 bone marrows and one spinal tap during the course of her treatment.  She has had severe back pain for the last several years.  She completed 2 rounds of physical therapy.  She saw a pain management docotor who just wanted to put her on more meds instead of finding a solution to the problem.  This has caused great difficulty with her moving forward with a job search.  She cant stand for long periods of time.  As a parent, it is just hard t know what to do...how much to push.  Have you ever heard of this problem before?  Thanks!","For symptomatic relief, sometimes pain medicines may be necessary. You must consult your doctor who treated for AML to suggest as spine pain is often seen in AML patients and with his experience he may point to the real cause, if possible. Second help can be from orthopedic surgeon who may have radiological investigations after testing spine for physical signs and if thinks could be due to spinal pathology primarily, then suggest for remedy."
"I had botox treatments done on my armpits for excessive sweating about 17 months ago. Since then I get these sore lumps in my armpits that come and go. I ve been to my family physician twice to be sure it s not breast cancer . Both times she s told me they are on the surface, to put a warm cloth on them and if they don t go away come back for antibiotics for a possible infection. Can anyone shed some light on this. What is causing it? Was it related to the Botox treatments? Why was this not told to me as possible side effect? Dose stress cause them to flair up? How many years can I expect this to be an issue? Even though my doctor has examined me twice I m thinking of seeking a second opinion and perhaps a mamaogram to ensure these lumps aren t something more serious or hiding another more serious lump.","The symptoms that you are getting now are one of the side effects of Botox therapy and the same should have been told to you at the time of Botox treatment. Your family physician has advised you rightly regarding the treatment of this problem. It is a self limiting problem and generally subsides by now. In some patients it may last for years. They have no relation to stress. In order to rule out an associated problem, it is advisable for you to undergo a bilateral mammogram or ultrasound (if you are less than 30 years)"
"I am 43 years old male, diagnosed with early stages of empChatDoctora. I have stopped smoking since being told. What outlook does this have for me, I m petrified. My doctor told me not to stress that if I quit smoking immediately, that I won t even notice the difference. The results were shown on a ct scan, he believes that the small holes may repair themselves, is this possible? I didn t thing it was possible to be reversed. Can you please help me with some information? Thank you kindly.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Emphysema is structural lung disease. It causes structural changes in lung. These changes are not reversible. These changes are permanent. The important thing is not these structural changes, but functional defect if present due to these changes is more important. So better to get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). If this is normal than no need to worry about lung damage. But if PFT suggests obstructive defect than you need to take inhaled treatment. Chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercises are also important. It is good that you have stopped smoking. So get done PFT and star chest physiotherapy. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."
my son is 14 months and he is vomiting every time i feed either in the middle of feeding or after so i went to the DR and he suggested i give him neogadine is it safe for him right now he is under medication coz his blood was tested and he was found with neutrophils,"Thanks for consulting at Chat Doctor. Neogadine is not used by pediatrician for treatment of vomiting. Neogadine Syrup contains Alcohol, Cyanocobalamin, Iodized Peptone, Magnesium Chloride, Manganese Sulfate, Nicotinamide, Pyridoxine, Sodium Metavanadate, and Zinc Sulfate and none of them is antiemetic. If your baby is vomiting during feeding or immediately after feeding then try feeding baby in small sips rather than big boluses, proper position while feeding, keeping baby upright over shoulder for 10-15 minutes after feeding. You may use medications like risperidone or ondansetron for vomiting. If not relived, consult pediatrician for further evaluation."
"Hello, my daughter is 3 and a half months old and has a Streptococcus pneumoniae infection of the left eye, I think that its in the nasolacrimal canal. We made the necesarry tests, and acording to the  antibiogram, the bacteria is sensitive to ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol. We did 2 week treatment (ciprofloxacin drops during the day and chloramphenicol ointment during the night), but the bacteria keeps coming back :-(. Im a pharmacist and I really tried everything I know, consulting her pediatrician and ophtalmologist, but no luck! Please help!","Welcome to ChatDoctorI have carefully read and understood you query hope you will find this usefulUnfortunately the Nasolacrimal duct infection keeps coming back as it has a blockage inside which needs to be ad Chat Doctor. But not very later than that. Surgical treatment includes probing and syringing of the duct for mechanical removal of the blockage. Probing failures are treated with more aggressive surgical procedures including balloon dacryoplasty and nasolacrimal duct intubation. Endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy is generally reserved for intubation and balloon dacryoplasty failures before that, the management is at home.Don't use Cipro or chloramphenicol too much. Replace it with antimycin which better in case of NLD infections in infants with less after effects. Important is to massage the medial side of the eye along the nose with the little finger, where the duct is. Give ten strokes four times a day. This is very effective in removing the blockage with pressure. But don't exert excessive pressure. If it does not work for till 8 months of age, see an ophthalmologist for intervention. I will be happy to know if you have found answer to your queryThank you"
"Yes, thank you,  I recently had complete lab work and everything was perfect except my eosinophil count was 510 where as before it was always very low 30 - 40  I am taking toporol xl 12.5 mg at night for approx 1 year and wondering if this is the cause. I feel very healthy otherwise","Hi, dear. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have high eosinophil count. There are many causes of high eosinophil count. Allergy, asthma, parasitic infection, hypersensitivity etc. Moreover, your eosinophil count is not much higher. It is slightly higher than normal. Your Chat Doctor.  Don't worry. Just be relaxed.

"hi,i had a problem with my stomach and a feeling to vomit and was prescribed some medicine known as esocip-20 for prevention of alot of acid in the stomach but am still having some stomach pains and a feeling of vomiting. what could be the cause of this? please help.","Hi, Thanks for posting your query. I am Chat Doctor. K and I am pleased to assist you. You have symptoms of increased acidity. Continue taking ESPCI 20 twice a day before food for relief. If there is no relief, get an upper GI endoscopy done to see what is causing the pain and nausea. The two most common causes are H.pylori infection and intake of painkiller medications. Get tested for H.pylori and if found to be positive you need to take 2 weeks of medication to eradicate it. Avoid painkiller medications, alcohol and smoking (if you have these habits). I hope that answers your question."
My name is Gaurav and I am 32 years old. I donot have any bad havit except chewing tobacco. Its been approximately 10 years now. I really want to quit chewing tobacco as my son doesn t like it. I did it twice for 5 days but can t sustain long. Please help with any prescription available to quite chewing tobacco.,"His admire your positive outlook and congratulate you for the attitude. Now I guess you have tobacco dependence, and it could be due to some stress in your personal life. In that case, you need some help. However, let me give my opinion here. I think a combination therapy of antidepressant like bupropion and nicotine chewing gums would help you. That would help to control the dose of tobacco. Nicotine chewing is available over the counter, but for bupropion you have to consult a psychiatrist. In case, you need further help, you can ask. Hope this helps."
"Hi,My son is 20 months old.He is suffering from cough in irregular intervals i.e atleast once in day he will get cough and if he vomit he will be fine..I have shown him to the pediatrician and he suggested Junior lanzol..can I know what is the reason for his cough","I understand your concern. It is possible that acid reflux, called HERD in which gastric acid regurgitates into esophagus is the cause of cough relieved with vomiting Unless there is no fever and cough with sounds of mucus / phlegm. I would do a CBC and evaluate chest for infection. Your doctor would have done this and started on a Chat Doctor.  You can discuss with your doctor and come back to me for any further doubts.

Dr. I had a epidural that led to paralysis of my right leg. A emergency laminectomy and decompression was performed the following day.

If both are normal than no need to worry about heart diseases. You are mostly having HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) associated chest pain. In HERD, along with Chat Doctor.  Avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed. Avoid smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first rule out cardiac diseases. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."
"Hi, Im a 18 year old college student and been taking Junel Fe for the past 6 months. For the past 6 months, my periods has been coming on the week I dont take my pills because my supply is only 21 days where the next week will allow for my period to start. One month it could be heavy, the next could be very light, or doest have anything at all and varies in length of days when it stops. My boyfriend and I do have unprotected sex and my period has not yet come on the second day where my period should start. Should I be concerned?","If you are taking the pills the way you describe, then you should be protected from pregnancy.  You are taking the pills properly.  Your period may be very light this time, and that is normal when taking the pills.  Some women don't bleed at all with their periods when they are on the pills, especially after taking them for a while.  This is normal and nothing to be concerned about.  Of course, you can take a pregnancy test to make sure, but I don't think that is necessary at all.  Just keep using the pills, and you will be fine.  I hope this was helpful to you, take care."

"I have a thoracic back injury that I haven t recovered from. I got my last set of intravertebral injections on Oct 22. The last 3 weeks my pain has been getting worse. Last night I found an indentation, if you will, around T4-T5. I m still working part time and finished only a two day consecutive schedule and I m in so much pain. Could the indentation(divet) in my back(soft tissue) be from a possible side effect of the injections?","Hi, Thanks for writing in. You might have had a severe back injury. Since you have found an indentation at T 4 - T 5 then you should get clinically examined and if required X-rays and CT scan or MRI scan of the thoracic spine is to be done. This will show the exact nature of injury. There are discs between bones in the spine, and it is important to know if your bones have reduced in height due to fracture after the injury and if the disc is bulging posteriorly and causing an indentation on the covering of spinal cord. If the disc is significantly causing obliteration of lateral recess and neural foramina compromise then the pain since 3 weeks might be due to this. Other than injections you can discuss treatments like radiofrequency ablation and nerve block. If there is severe disc problem then surgery might help. For the vertebra if there is a fracture and collapse where you find the indentation then vertebroplasty can be doe to restore the height of vertebra. Detailed discussion with your doctor is important. Please do not worry."
Hi I am taking treatment for psoriatic arthritis now i am getting low grade fever for about  one month so i stopped taking wysolone and neotextrate and took antibiotics to reduce the fever for about 1 week but still fever is coming and consulted general physician she told to consult dermotolgist and dermatologist told to consult orthopedician.i am not understanding what is going on with me. please help me,Hi. I have read your question and understand your concern. Low grade fever for one month can or cannot be because of psoriasis arthritis. You need a complete work up for your fever. Only after ruling out other causes can we be sure that the fever is because of psoriasis. For this I suggest you see a physician. Both cyclone and methotrexate are immunosuppressants and could have led to flare up of some infection which needs to be ruled out. As for the treatment of psoriasis arthritis methotrexate is most commonly employed Chat Doctor.  Usually cyclone is not advised for long term management of psoriasis arthritis. I suggest you talk to your rheumatologist to reconsider cyclone. Hope this answer helps. For further queries please get back to us. Thanks.

"Good morning, I have the worst headaches starting at the back of my neck going all the way to the top of my head associated with needles and pins in my hands and feet. My muscles are sore throughout my body. Been having this for 7 years including 2 Carpal Tunnel operations as well as a neck operation. They also did a Risotomy procedure . Any ideas? I live on grandpa powders and pain killers.","Hi, Thanks for writing in. It looks like you had rhizome procedure done for neck pain. In this procedure the selected nerve roots are blocked and this reduces the pain. As you have been having this neck pain for 7 years and now headache and tingling have also started therefore it will help to go back to your neurosurgeon and get an MRI scan of cervical spine done. This will show any new developments and disc changes that require attention and treatment so that your pain is treated. New procedures like laser assisted disc surgery and radiofrequency ablation are in use to release pressure over the pinched nerve roots and block the pain sensations in the area. These are well accepted by many patients, and please discuss these treatments as you have already had a neck surgery without much relief in symptoms. Since it might be surgically difficult to decompress the nerves at various levels, doing radiofrequency ablation of nerve roots might be a better choice."

I recently had a root canal on an infected tooth. I am now having issues with sore lymph nodes in my neck mad under both arms. Do you think the infection is still present in my body? I have a temporary crown but is seriously considering just having the tooth extracted to get some relief.,"Hello there, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Lymph node enlargement or lymphadenopathy is seen in any kind of bacterial and viral infections in the body. It can rarely be associated with a root canal treated tooth. Lymphadenopathy in the neck area can be due to infected tooth but that of under the arms is totally a different issue. Exact diagnosis can be made only after clinical examination and evaluation by taking radiographs. I would suggest you to get an OPG radiograph done which will help in diagnosis and accordingly treatment can be planned. Consult an oral surgeon and get the examination done.I hope this helps, take care."

"Sir,My Toxoplasma IGg Level presently is >200 and Cytomegalo virus IGg is about 176.4. Doctor prescribed me to take Rovamycine fortee. Also I am taking Metformin tableta for PCOD. Can i take both medicines together ?  How long to wait for next pregnency?","HelloThanks for writing to us with your health concern. The IG G level DOES NOT MATTER. It just indicates past infection with the agent. In fact, it means that you have acquired good immunity, and do not require any medication for the same. Ig M means that there is recent infection, and if the IG M is positive, then that indicates that treatment is required. There is no need in your case to take Kanamycin Forte, unless IG M levels also are raised. If the IG M levels are normal, then there is no need to wait for planning a pregnancy.IN fact take daily folic acid tablets if planning for a baby. All the best."

It occurs sometimes but it is worst today in past 3 months since it started.","Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. First, due to stress, our heart beat rate and blood pressure rate varies. When we take rest it comes to normal. But when we become anxious about the heart beat, pulse, BP etc., they rise whenever we think about them. In one way this can be called obsession. You had that disturbing sensation once. You expected it to happen again and tried. Then you started experiencing it as you were expecting it. Then your body brought the familiar symptom because you are expecting it. Then you started worrying that the symptom is coming again and again and expect it. Body brings it again as you are expecting it. You become worried and so on. That is obsession in simple terms.

Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

"Hi, back in march I was diagnosed with poison oak/ivy on my lower legs. My doctor prescribed prednisone for about 13 days(20mg...3aday for 3 days, 2aday for 3days and so on). My legs did start to clear up. However I started new rashes on my stomach,arms,under breast that appear to be contact dermititis and about a week or so after finishing the meds, he put me on another round of prednisone for about 9days..same strength and also gave me a prednisone shot. The rash starting looking better. I also took some oatmeal baths,using aveeno lotion,and taking benydryl as well.But here I am again, and about 4days to a week later after finishing prednisone and I am in worse shape. My rash is more wide spread, but doesn t always itch but it can be painful around my bra line..i guess from the heat/sweat. Do you have any idea why this is happening? Thanks.","Hi Dear, Understanding your concern. As per your query you have symptoms of skin rash all over the body which could be due to hormonal disturbances and allergic reaction of body. I would suggest you to visit dermatologist once and get it examined. You should go for patch test for allergic reaction. Start treatment after proper examination and diagnosis.

"I have Asthma and receive 2 allergy shorts every four week. In September I was hospitalized for a upper respiratory infection and an inpatient for 5 days. I work in a hospital and have a co worker who sprays Lysol every morning very heavy. I ask her to stop this and also told my supervisor. She did not use the spray for 2 or 3 days, but came back to work this week and is using Lysol stray again.

"I have been diagnosed with small fiber neuropothy. I am not diabetic. I am thinking of taking alpha lipoid acid but do not know the brand and how much to I should take. I have also taken antibiotics that contain fluoroquinolones which I understand could be the cause of the peripheral neuropothy. Please tell me what you recommend Thank you, Kathy","First, I would like to ask you that on what basis you was diagnosed to have small fiber neuropathy?

My girlfriend had a duplicate kidney removed about 2 years ago. She frequently gets utis and has recently in the last month had 3. She gets antibiotics and issue goes way. Ten about 10-15 days later it occurs again. She notes this by noticing a tingling sensation beginning in her vagina wich quickly leads to pain and overall discomfort. Her URologist has thought it at be due to her ureter from the dupulcate kidney was not properly closed and has caused a breeding ground for bacteria.- thus evading to her uti. The problem is she does not always test positive for a uti. She will be following up with her urologist again soon but I was wondering if there might be some additional tests se shod ask to be done?,"Hello, Your urologist is right in suspecting infection arising in the ureter. Usually any kind of abnormalities in renal physiology can cause frequent and recurrent urinary tract infection. Urine test may be negative for microorganism since there is a minimum required level of bacteria are needed for a positive result. Urine results may not be correlated with the level of symptoms experienced and this is particularly true for women. So she needs to take antibiotics when there are signs of UTI. Also consult your urologist for further course of action. Bye"

It healed after 10 hrs.(i was bitten at midnight. wound healed after the night sleep.) i didnt consult the doctor on day 1. But after many suggestion, i thought of having Vaccine just for the safety purpose. I took Rabipur and TT(titness) vaccine on day 3, about 50hr from the bite. now i have scheduled vaccine to take, (4 more injection). Am i safe.... ????? Or the delay was more?","Dear Friend. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. I have read your query in detail. Furthermore, I understand your concern. You should take Rabies vaccination as early as possible after bite. Since was exposure was not very high, Vaccination would help you. If you want to be very sure, you may take Immunoglobulins, that are costly but would provide you best safety against rabies. If possible keep a watch on the puppy, in case it shows any awkward symptoms, contact the nearest health facility. This is my best opinion for you based on available details.

"I have never done this before? I have chronic back pain ever since 1998 when I was T-boned by a drunk driver when my family and I went to the air and sea show in Ft. Lauderdale, FL. I had really great insurance, unfortunately, my company went under when the economy went down in 2008. Needless to say, I was with my company for over 16 years and when they shut their doors my whole life took a turn for the worst! I had to work wherever the unemployment office would send me which were jobs that were paying nothing compared to what I was making and would eventually lay me off when it was time for the probation to be over so that they would not have to pay for my benefits! They actually can get away with that in Florida! I have been bounced around so many jobs that it s not even funny! At one job I fell in the rain on one step! Can you believe that, I slipped on one step and I saw god when the corner of that step hit my right side but I was being a trooper and eventually left at 3:00 p.m. cause I could not take the pain any longer! I ve been out of work since they eventually I got laid off and am in the process of applying for Social Security Benefits. I am 58 years old and I have been to a pain management doctor which only takes cash payments which are now up to $240 every 28 days (he doesn t give refills) I couldn t afford him anymore but I am going crazy with this pain. He would prescribe to me Lorcets 10/625 (which generic is hydrocodone/acetamin) then reduced it to 10/325, gabepentin, flexiral, valium, adderrall. I had to stop seeing him, his office was like something out of a weird movie where you see the zombies come out! Anyway, I couldn t afford him anymore but I still suffer from this pain, I have herniated, bulging discs in my back. I have the MRI that states such. I cannot take this pain anymore, I am truly suffering, sometimes I get really bad thoughts because of this pain! I take extra strength tylenols like candy and they make my stomach so sick and they don t do the job cause after taking the prescribed medication, this is like eating candy. Is there anything that you can do to help me with my pain? Like I mentioned before, I have never done anything like this on line and I so hope that one of you doctors can help me? Thank you. Oh by the way, would you be able to prescribe me with something for this horrible pain?","Hello, Its really hurting to know of your condition, and I empathize with you. I appreciate the bravery you have shown despite such a situation. The extent of disc bulge in MRI and severeness of neural symptoms like paresthesia if limb decide is an operative spine treatment is needed. There are some Chat Doctor.  Other therapy is steroid injection at the nerve root and this may give somewhat long term relief along with spinal physiotherapy and wearing belt."
On day 13 th my follicle size was 18 x 16....was given ChatDoctor shot then itself...when i returned to hospital on day 15th for u/s for follicular study i got to know that the right side ovary/follicle had grown to 25 x 21....does this mean that i did not ovulate after 36 hours of ChatDoctor shot? Why is the size this big? Is it cyst?,"Hello, The cyst which is seen is most likely a corpus luteal cyst, which is formed after the rupture of the follicle that is ovulation. There are certain other signs also on USG to confirm ovulation like irregularity of cyst, free fluid in pelvis, increased blood flow around the cystic area which should also be taken into consideration. Still in small percentage of cases, the follicle might not rupture and remain as lutenist unruptured follicle. Hope this is helpful."
"I am 62 years old and have Empty Sella Syndrome. My doctor took me off of Hormone Replacement Therapy because she is afraid I will get cancer. I feel miserable and I know I need HRT. I went to an endocrinologist and all he did was experiment on me. Some medications were too weak and others too strong. Will HRT cause cancer and where do I go to find a doctor with knowledge of ESS? I live in Daly City, CA and use doctors at Mills Peninsula Hospital.","The longer one-person takes HRT the more their breast and ovary cancer risk increases. But there was only an increased risk after 15 years use for hormone sensitive breast cancers (estrogen or progesterone receptor positive) and after 20 years use for all types of breast cancer. The researchers say that the risk of breast cancer after 20 years use is about 40% higher. So, in women taking estrogen only HRT for 20 years, these researchers expect that 49 women would get breast cancer out of every thousand. In women not taking HRT, 35 out of a thousand would be expected to develop breast cancer. Regards Chat Doctor."

"Hello Dr. Christensen, I have been having heart palpitations. Actually they feel more like skipped beats. They started about 6 months ago. However, they are becoming more frequent (happening daily for 4 days now). With the first day having an extreme attack of skipped beats in a row which threw me for a loop while I was at the supermarket. I have been diagnosed with anxiety but for some reason these seem different. It is not so much my heart racing like an anxiety attack it is a skipped beat. Also, I don t have a panic when they are happening like an anxiety attack. I also do not feel dizzy or pass out or any other symptom but complete discomfort! Also, the only other symptom is that I feel like belching when they skip a beat (I know that sounds crazy). I am 46 years old and believe that I might be in the stages of perimenopause. My menstrual cycle, although pretty regular, only lasts a day now. I also seem to have pms all the time! I think I have about 1 or 2 good days out of the month. My husband has said I have PMA (pretty much always!..lol) I did go to a physician for the skipped beats and they happened when he listened to my heart (for about not even a minute). I am on meds for BP ( atenolol ). The doctor told me to up my dose to 50 mg (I was on 25 mg). It hasn t done anything for the palps at all! Also, my blood pressure wasn t high on my normal dose that I was previously on. I am also on Xanax for anxiety. I do take the xanax when the palps are happening and it doesn t help either. The doctor did order some bloodwork and I do have to return to see him after I get the bloodwork done. However, at this time, I do not have health insurance since I started a new job and cannot afford for all sorts of expensive testing. I do have a stressful job working for a family law attorney and have been doing this type of work for over 20 years. Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance! Regards, Laurie","Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your query. It is possible that your palpitations could be anxiety related. Especially, the premenopausal period is a period where hormonal imbalances can also contribute to changes in mood or an increase in the anxiety levels. It is important to understand that anxiety can present with not only psychological symptoms but also with physical or somatic symptoms. Shakiness, dizziness, fast heart rate (palpitations), etc. are symptoms which are commonly seen in anxiety disorders.  However, considering your age and since you mention that you sometimes have """"skipped beats"""", it is also important to rule out a cardiac cause. So, I would advise you to have an ECG done to rule out the possibility of a cardiac arrhythmia.  For your anxiety symptoms, in addition to the medication, I would suggest that you try relaxation therapies, like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, etc. Avoiding excessive stress and adopting a healthy lifestyle with regular food and sleep habits and regular physical exercise is also essential. Wish you all the best."

"Let me start by saying Im a mess! First off, I am a 32 yo black female and I have been having head pressure/ headaches/ numbness on left side of face/ ear pressure/ dizziness for about a year. Went to ER and they did a MRI, but to no avail, it didnt show anything! They wrote it off as migraines and they prescribed Tramadol.  Recently, Ive been experiencing tingling mostly in my legs, but occasionally in arms as well. Ive been fatigued, anxious, moody, and depressed. My body is generally achy and stiff especially when standing up from a seated position. I really need to get bloodwork asap because I think that whatever is going on is probably pretty serious. So, from my list of annoying ailments, do you have any earthly idea of what could be going on with me?","Hello ! I understand your concern. In my opinion there is nothing to worry about. Dizziness, headaches, ear pressure, tinglings may be caused by an orthostatic hypotension. I would recommend a full blood count to rule out anemia. A measurement of blood pressure in sitting position and after 5 minutes in standing up position would be necessary to rule out orthostatic hypotension. If there is a decrease of more than 20mmHg to your systolic blood pressure when standing up it may be an orthostatic hypotension. All these symptoms can also be caused by depression. If all examinations are all right, I would recommend an Antidepressant like Paroxetine, Duloxetine or Escitalopram for some months. It will help with headaches and your humor too.

I took a long time to realize that I was depressed. I went to a psychiatrist about 3 months ago. He prescribed me antidepressants named Nexital-10 mg and Alzolam-0.25 mg for the first time.

"Hi, I am staying in Singapore. I had seizures after my delivery. It was for the first time. I was taking Kepra for 6 months. Later I had some anxiety related issues, so had zapiz .5 Then stopped the zapiz. After 1 month or so, I was affected by vertigo followed by anxiety symptoms. Now I have headache almost everyday. So I called my doc in India and taking zapiz .5. When I reduce it to half a dosage I am having the headache again. Now I am confused how long should I have zapiz with one full medicine dosage.","Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Zapiz is a benzodiazepine, commonly used for treating anxiety. It has a high probability of causing addiction, if used for long. So, I suspect you are developing an addiction to it. That is the reason, as soon as you stop it, symptoms recur.First, we need to determine the cause of your headaches. If it is migraine, then, we need to use preventive medications. Since you have seizures also, topiramate or divalproex would be a better option than Kendra (levetiracetam), as they would help both seizures and migraines. For coming out of rapid, you may take the help of a psychiatrist. I hope it helps. Please get back if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, Chat Doctor. Ly/"

I ve been taking tri-Sprintec for a 13months now. I missed one of my pill the other day. So the next day I took two pills instead of 1. But the problem is now I had unprotected sex and he cum inside me. Now im worried that I could be pregnant? Please help me. This just happen yesterday? Should I take the morning after pill or should I just wait?,"Hello. Whether you need backup birth control after missing a birth control pill depends on where you were in your pack when you missed the pill. For combination BCP's like Tri-Sprintec, if you miss one of the first two pills in the pack, you should take the forgotten pill as soon as you remember and the next at its usual time (just like you did). You should then use a backup method of birth control (e.g., condoms) for one week. If you missed a pill from day 3 through 21 of your pack, you should take the forgotten pill as soon as you remember it and the next at its usual time (as above). Backup birth control is not required in this case. If you missed one of the inactive pills (the white ones), you don't need to take the forgotten pill, and no backup birth control is needed.""""b""""Given those scenarios, you can decide whether you need emergency contraception. Specifically, if you missed one of the first two pills of your pack and had unprotected sex within a week, you should take emergency contraception. Otherwise, emergency contraception isn't indicated. I hope that answers your question!"

For cold, you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Warm saline gargles will be soothing and will give a lot of relief if the kid can do that. Regards -"

"I ve recently started taking Oxy Elite Pro.

I ve change my diet and started working out and lost over 60 lbs in the last 90 day or so days. I am happy with the results but am concerned about the side effects.

Oxyleite-Pro is an over the counter nutritional supplement claimed to be effective for weight loss, fat reduction, appetite suppression, and increased energy.

With any form of hormone contraception, it is usual to experience some menstrual disturbances during the initial couple of months owing to alteration of the hormone milieu. As the body adjusts to the new status, the situation is stabilized.

Infection is indicated due to presence of excess pus cells in semen. Normally semen shouldn't contain any pus cells. No growth of organisms may be due to many reasons, you may go for repeat culture and sensitivity. You may need investigations like routine hologram, random blood sugar, semen culture and sensitivity, ultrasound of scrotum. You may need to take antibiotics based on culture and sensitivity report. Motility is normal. Normally it should be at least 55 %. Your findings suggest over all 60% motility, so it is normal. Sperm count is also normal. It should be at least 20 millions/ml. Other factors like semen amount, pH,morphology etc. are normal. Fertility is expected to increase with control of infection. If infertility persists then you may need assisted fertilization techniques. Get well soon. Take Care Chat Doctor."
"Hi my 10month old baby has had a temperature over the past 24 hrs however this has come down with the use of Calpol. Overnight I noticed red spots on her bum and legs, but they do blanch. They dont look like measles. Any ideas as to what it is, as I am nervous for her. Thank you.","Welcome to the ChatDoctorI have gone through your question. Don't worry. The red spots on skin which blanch are usually suggestive of insect or mosquito bites. It occurs due to release of histamines in response to bites leading to dilated blood capillary. It usually subsides over a couple of days. You may apply Lactocalamine lotion for early resolution of skin lesions. You are right that they are not due to measles. Measles rashes appear on 3rd day of fever. For fever continue cal pol. You may repeat the dose every 6-8 hourly if fever persists. Most common reason for fever in this age is self limiting viral infections. But in case it doesn't resolve over next 3-4 days or there are any new symptoms, then do visit your pediatrician. Hopefully this will help you. Take care"

Just funny. kinda feels like its shaky...I talked to the dr today and she acted like I was nuts. She did take blood and said she call me next week. Should I be on calcium and vitamin B as well?,"Hi, Thanks for writing in. There are many causes for a fluttering heart beat, and it is possible that the Synthroid 200 might be causing it in you. The freezing feeling and hot and sweaty at times can be from thyroid imbalance. This is to be evaluated after doing thyroid function test and then knowing any abnormal values. Calcium is a natural ion required in our food and women over 50 years need more calcium because there is a tendency to develop osteoporosis after menopause. Therefore, taking calcium is beneficial for you and in the recommended dose it will keep you in good health. Vitamin B in many types is required for functioning of cells and nerves. This is a water-soluble vitamin and essential micro nutrient. Please take plenty of fruits and vegetables which are natural sources of vitamin B. You can take supplement which is available.

Failure to completely cover the penis. 3. Forceful pulling out of the penis from vagina after completion of intercourse. After completing intercourse, the girl should abduct her thighs and then let the penis slip off the vagina of its own. When such care is taken, condom is very good contraceptive device.

Bladder irritation could be as a result of combination of several things or just one thing. It could be related to infection as you mentioned.

If it is related to the medication, you can decrease the medication to half a dose after consulting with your doctor for several days. If it is improved you will know that it is related to that. Then he can give another medication which does not have this side effect. Best wishes."
"I am 46, 5ft 5 and approx 11stone. I have a painful lump on my lower left jaw which appears to be unattached to anything as it can move about. I also have pain down the left side of my neck. I visited my GP today who diagnosed stones in my salivary glands. The GP prescribed co-amoxiclav. He did not look in my mouth at all. Why did he prescribe antibiotics when as I understand it there is no infection there?","Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern. As per your query painful lump on jaw which is movable along with neck pain is because of salivary gland stones, which cause obstruction of normal flow of saliva and leads to its accumulation and swelling and pain. Doctor did not look into your mouth because its not oral cavity or teeth related as then swelling will be hard and immovable. Antibiotics are given because if there is any infection due to stones it will not further spread and get healed then and there. I would suggest you not to worry about anything. For small stones, stimulating saliva flow by sucking on a lemon or sour candies can cause the stone to pass spontaneously. Dentist can remove small stone by massage or by push out the stone from duct. For larger stone you need to visit dentist and get it excised as small incision will remove the stone. Sialendoscopy is recent treatment to remove salivary stones. Hope your concern has been resolved. Best Wishes,"
I started taking althea even I havent have my menstruation yet. Because I read in the paper inside the box of althea pills that its ok to take during the menstruation or any other time. I havent finish all the tablet so I dont have may menstruation for almost 1month more.  Am i safe?Im worried about it.,"Hi, Althea pills are usually taken starting from day one of the menstrual cycle, but they can also be taken at any time, the only precaution being that pregnancy has been excluded before taking them in such a manner and follow up with condoms is done for first seven days. In the current scenario, you should go for n estimation of the serum beta-ChatDoctor titles, if you do not see a period within the seven days of pill break. A trans-vaginal sonogram and a clinical evaluation by an expert are also needed. Take care."

I had some pain in my big toe and went to see a Chinese doctor who did a blood test and later told me i have romatism. I have no idea about this sickness and would like to learn more about it and if it is cureable or not? I would also like to know is only on my toe or will it be all over my body?,"Hi, (Actually, the proper spelling is Rheumatism, not dogmatism).  Rheumatism is not a single disease, it is a group of disorders that cause inflammation in joints, muscles and/or other soft tissues. There are several diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, SHE, Scleroderma, Psoriasis, Gout, etc. and all of them are a kind of Rheumatism.  Overall, the diagnosis of a Rheumatic disease is based on your history, examination and lab tests. You should only refer to an Internist or a Rheumatologist for proper diagnosis.  Some Rheumatic disorders only involve one joint and some others involve other joints and even other parts of the body such as kidney, heart, etc. The major treatment for these disorders are the Chat Doctor.  Although other treatments also exist. In most cases, rheumatic diseases cannot be totally cured, but with the help of proper medication the pain and other problems will go away, and the disease will be off for a long time.  I suggest that if the doctor that you saw was not an Internal Medicine specialist or a Rheumatologist, you refer to another doctor to be sure that your problem is hematologic.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
"Im a 39 yr female, who recently quit smoking and is still taking chantix. (The only side-efffect Ive noticed has been slight nausea-until now).My heartrate is normally low but today it has been 42-46 bpm. with shortness of breath and dizziness.  I dont have health ins, but at what point is it necessary to contact a doctor?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor, It's simple to understand that how smokers become difficult to breath and get feeling of dizziness. Our tracheobronchial tree consists of smooth muscle fibers, and any muscle get contracts or spasm with effect on smoke or cold. Now, if anyone who is already have their tracheobronchial muscles allergic to spasm and in addition when they get smoky or cold air, this smooth muscles begin to contract leading to constriction of tracheobronchial tree turned into unable to get air exchange and difficulty in breathing. Inhalers makes this muscles relaxed or dilatation in medical terms within seconds. Now, if your shortness of breath and dizziness is not troubling your day-to-day life then there is no need to see a doctor and sometimes it might get subsided by itself but in case if problem is persistent then you should see pulmonologist.

I had cortisone shots in both thumbs last Friday along with carpal tunnel surgery in right wrist. My wrist feels great! no more tingling numb fingers But thumbs hurt a lot and seem much worse! I can not pinch or twist open anything. Am I trying too soon?,Taking cortisone is the last second line of medical practice.

My problim is I feel sick! Just tonight but it has been going on all evening and am due to take the lyrics and the targin if I dont take them Ill be in agony with my back within an hour as am already late. Doctor, what should I do?.Louise","Hello Louise, Thanks for posting on Chat Doctor, Given that the medications margin (generic names: oxycodone/naloxone combination) and lyrics (generic name: pregabalin) can be very addictive together and so should be used with a lot of caution. It is true that they are good for such conditions as chronic back pain and may relieve your symptoms, but getting addicted to them will instead become a problem that will have to be solved as you can not be on those for the rest of your life (I do not recommend continuous use). Your pain management doctor may advise other treatment options and give you alternative medications or therapies such as physical therapy/chiropractor. If I was to treat you, I will change your medications to equivalents such as tricyclic antidepressants (that can treat both nerve pain and depression that came as a result of the pain) and also anti-inflammatory for about 1-2 months. Refer you to a physical therapist for that period until I can see you again in 2-3 months after which I will be able to see if treatment is effective or not. I also recommend you see a rheumatologist. Hope this helps"

Fungal nail infections can only be adequately treated with oral tablets which have to be taken for a few weeks for them to have a maximum effect. In many cases they would have to be used for 6 to 12 weeks. In terms of effects on your liver and kidney, most persons use the medications with no effects, so the risk is there but is not experienced by the majority of persons on the medication.

Physiotherapy has to be done only after the acute pain has subsided.* Judicious use of analgesics and muscle relaxants.

He s been to his doctor and yesterday the emergency room. They did a CT of his head and found everything normal . His blood work is normal, a chest X-ray was normal but he is laying on the floor and I just don t know what to do. I m using his email address.","Hello! I understand your concern. In my opinion he should have thyroid hormones' analysis. Difficulty in concentrating is a common feature in thyroid hormones' disbalance. A stroke has been ruled out, so you should not worry. I would also recommend a cervical vessel ultrasound to see the blood flow to the brain. He has a stent and this means that other vessels must be checked for narrowing. These symptoms can also be caused by low blood flow to the brain because a carotid or vertebral stenosis. Although these disorders cause much more problems than just difficulty in concentrating and dizziness. Hope to have been helpful! Thank you for using Chat Doctor!"

They said my white blood cell count is high & they took an ultrasound of my gallbladder & kidney on the right side & said everything looked fine. They then gave me a drink that said it would help me poop bc they thought the pain was due to being full of poop. That was at 3:00pm & said to come back in 12-24 hours if still not feeling well.

Read and understood that you are 13 weeks pregnant and 31 years old, that you have severe upper abdominal pains radiating to the lower back, ultrasonography is normal, laxatives given in a hope that passing stools may help. I would suggest you to visit the ER again, explain to them that you have severe pain and that you are pregnant also. The causes of placental separation or such a severe cause like some vascular accidents has also to be borne in mind. Insist on admission and further investigations is a must as such a pain can induce abortion and its complications."

"Hello, I am a 60 year old female who started taking 25 mg of Losartan daily about 4 months ago. my blood pressure has dropped some since I started taking it but is sill not in the normal range. Was 170 s over 90 s when I started taking it and is not normally 140 s-150 s over 70 s. I spent the last 24 hours with my daughter who is going through some traumatic circumstances and returned home this evening to find my blood pressure is measuring around 165-175 for the top number and 99 -102 for the bottom number. I am trying to relax and my blood pressure has gone down a bit since I got home (167-98) but I m wondering if I should go to the ER or if I could just take an aspirin to help for the moment? I actually have a physical scheduled for tomorrow afternoon so that will be handy but would like to know:1) exactly what my blood pressure needs to be where it is bad enough to go to the hospital (obviously not where I would like to spend the evening) 2) Is were something I can do right now, such as take a low dose aspirin to help reduce my blood pressure without having to go the hospital? Thanks for your help! Marie","Hello, Your blood pressure is a little high despite the use of losartan. I can understand that you have had a stressed day and that may contribute to higher blood pressure. If you don't have any other disease (renal disease), you can take another Losartan. If you were my patient, I would give you HY Chat Doctor.  It takes a few weeks to start acting. Meanwhile, you take daily or twice a day Losartan. It can low your blood pressure.

"Hello, im 21, today at the gym i was on the cross trainer for under 10 minutes, i wasnt working hard at all and wasnt tired. the heart rate read 196. i am a tiny bit worried because when i used to run more regularly i used to blackout after going for runs. Im not sure if i should seek help or not","Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would explain that it is normal to have an increased heart rate during physical activity, especially when you are not performing regularly physical activity and your body can be over-stressed by the physical exercise. The episodes of blackouts after going for runs are a little concerning. They could be related to a low blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension), low blood glucose, hyperventilation or cardiac arrhythmia. I recommend you to consult with your GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest X-ray study and some blood lab tests : -complete blood count-thyroid hormone levels-blood electrolytes- kidney and liver function tests - fasting glucose. A treadmill test may be necessary to exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia related to physical exercise. You should discuss with your doctor on the above-mentioned issues. Hope to have been of help!

This is a standard dose schedule and is recommended. The dog is healthy and vaccinated so there in no immediate risk from rabies. You have also mentioned that the dog is at home and never comes in contact with strays. With the above information, it is best to give your daughter a single shot of the same vaccine.

I take 400mg wellbutrin and 60 mg prozac daily. I also take yaz. Today I had a large coffee and took A vivarin tablet that was 200mg. I felt okay most of the day but now I am lying in bed and I feel my heart rhythm is abnormal. Whats going on? How bad is this and should I do anything about it?,"Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I totally understand your concern. But you should not worry. I will try to explain you something. This abnormal heart rhythm has to do with some electrical issues in the heart. Some electrical impulses that generate in a part of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm cause premature heart contraction that you feel like skipped beats, abnormal rhythm. This might be just ekstra-sistolic beats or other different arrhythmia. The extra-sistolik beats generally are followed by a pause till the next normal heart contraction. If these are not frequent, in Young and normal heart, it is nothing to worry about. There are different factors that might cause this skipped beats or arrhythmias like emotional stress, excessive coffee consumption, coca-cola or energy Chat Doctor. As you explain, you are under Prozac, an antidepressant medication. It is quite known in medicine that stress disorders might cause high frequencies, exra-sistolic beats. All sow pathology like anemia or hyperthyroidism might be other causes of this rhythm issues. So, if I was your treating doctor I would say that you have nothing to worry if this happens once a wile, its normal because of stress or coffee usage. But if they begin to bother you and interfere in your live we can decide to do some examinations like a blood analyze, your thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder rhythm monitoring to have a full view of your rhythm. Only than we can decide what we should do. Hope I was helpful. Best regards."

"sir, I am asking this question from India. i think i have got ringworm infection. (ring shaped fungal infection in the groin). I have applied itch guard for the past one week or so. itching has gone, but i still see dark marks on my skin. Should i use a different ointment to treat the above infection?thanks,venkat.","Itch guard contains the active antifungal medication clotrimazole which is an effective topical treatment for ringworm (along with many other fungal skin infections). The darkened color of the skin where the ringworm was could be due to the inflammation caused by the infection. This is a known medical phenomenon called """"post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation"""". In any case, I usually tell my patients to continue using antifungal cream for at least a week after the symptoms resolve to make sure you have fully eradicated the fungal infection."
"Hi there,May i ask you the question? My mom is 60+ old and it s about 8 years ago. She hurt her ankle while she was getting off from the bus. At that time she little pain, and getting swelling and difficult to walk. I took her to the doctor and got X-ray and video x-ray too. and report shows there is some bone came backward and there is rust around the ankle. what is the treatment for that because i am worried about her. She is old and its hard to walk. Please give me some idea that can help her and at least she can feel better for a while. Thank you.Sansar","Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised. As the x-ray and video x-ray is performed which shows some sort of anatomical changes in the bone position looking for the further management will be possible. Kindly meet up a physical therapy, as with videotaping there ankle joint can be made stabilize. Using an android is also the another option. Performing guided physical therapy exercises for strengthening the muscles around the joint should help regain the mobility of the ankle joint. As it is a weight-bearing joint it needs a proper strength and stability. Recovery can be slower than expected as she is 60 Years old. In my clinical practice most geriatric cases respond well to physical therapy. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor."

Complexion of any person is having two components; constitutive, one which is predetermined by genetics and racial factors and usually cannot be changed with any treatment.

The panic attack happened with the symptoms of this. I felt a freezing cold sensation in my feet which rose up my legs and into my chest and armpits. I can describe this similarly to the feeling of when having a catscan I think it is and they inject you with that chemical that makes your groind and armpits feel very warm, except it was freezing cold. Along with that my heart started pounding and I was twitching and trembling. I was sweeting profusely and I had the feeling that I was about to die.

"Hi I m male, 19 years old, 6 3, 160. I have had a fairly bad sore throat for the past 2 weeks. I suddenly came down with extreme fatigue, muscle aches, headache, and other flu like symptoms. I got tested for both strep and mono and those came back negative. I was prescribed amoxacilin (spelling?) for a sinus infection, but I ve never heard of a sinus infection causing muscle aches or chills. I got a flu shot about a month ago, but there is still a chance I have the flu. Here s the kicker--I ve known for a while that my boyfriend has herpes. We ve used condoms every time we ve had anal intercourse, but not for oral (I know, we ve been careless). I haven t had any outbreaks on my genitals, but there have been other symptoms that I passed off as minor that have turned up online as possible herpes indicators (lower back pain, tingling face/cheeks, etc). Is there a possibility I contracted this and just haven t had sores yet?","Hello, I read carefully your query and understand your concern. Your symptoms seem to be related to cold or flu like symptoms. So, I suggest using anti-inflammatory medications such as Tylenol to relieve the muscle soreness and headache.

She has been taking these religeously and still doesnt feel better she acts like shes stoned and cannot stand at all. I dont know what to do",Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Brown phlegm with chest pain is more suggestive of lung infection. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done chest x-ray. If chest x-ray is showing lung infection (pneumonia) then she should be admitted and start Intravenous fluid and antibiotics. So don't wait at home. Consult pulmonologist and discuss all these.

Hi Drs my name is asmaa i was taking northisteron for about 3 weeks because i went for a holiday. And also I am planning to get pregnat. After stopping it I get swollen and sore brest as well as i feel sick everyday for 4 weeks I am wondering are these symptoms from northisteron? the other thing could northisteron decrese my chances from getting pregnant?,"Hallow Dear Asmara, Norethisteroe is a Progesterone preparation. It does cause engorgement and soreness of the breasts. If increases the acidity and also due to effect on liver, it does cause nauseating feeling. However, after discontinuing the medicines, these symptoms should not persist.  Norethisterone being progestational medicine, may act like birth control pill; however after discontinuing the pills, it should not create any problem in conception. You do have good chances of pregnancy provided you are releasing your eggs fairly regularly, there is no block anywhere in your genital organs and the husband has a good quality semen. You may get these tested if you do not conceive in fair time. Currently, if you have not missed your period and are still sick for more than 4 months, please report to your physician to get your Liver function test done. Norethisterone may diminish the function of liver and then these symptoms may continue. Take Folic acid tablets daily. I hope this helps you."
"Hello, I have very week veins as I had a lot of iv meds now after three weeks of the canulas being out of my hand and arm my hand and wrist is very sore and lumpy with numbness in my right hand near the site of the canula. My left arm has two lumps from another canula site which is turning black and the lump is becoming bigger and sorer. Should I see my GP or will it go away I think its thrombosis of the vein in my left arm . Thank you","Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint large painful lump at the site of cannula insertion can be due to a few reasons like Hematoma formation, formation of a blood clot in the vein at the site of Cannula insertion or can also be due to localized infection leading to abscess formation. I would suggest you to consult your treating physician and get evaluated and in case of hematoma formation alternate warm and cool compresses will relieve, for pain you can take anti-inflammatory painkiller like Ibuprofen, but in case of infection oral and injectable antibiotics are needed for resolution of infection. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor."

That may be the reason for high blood pressure. You will wonder how it happened as your thyroid gland has reduced activity. Your thyroxine dose may be high at the moment. So that can be the reason for symptoms of increased activity of thyroidism. So please consult your family physician. He will arrange TSH and T4 for you. If TSH low you have to reduce your thyroxine dose. It will improve your blood pressure too.

"Hello, My husband woke with a bulging bubble like blister on his gum near a tooth and a smaller one below it. He went to his dentist in fear it was an abscess . They confirmed it was and said he needed to have the tooth(6 of them) pulled after comparing an x ray to his last one. They called his teeth hopeless. They sent him home to think about what he wanted to do ( lots of $ involved), and they did not give him antibiotics for the abscess. He is in pain tonight and I want him to go to the er after reading what one can do. He already has tests being done due to some abnormal liver results. Isn t this dangerous to be left untreated for a period of time?","Dear jswflaIf the prognosis for the teeth has been determined as hopeless as it has to be extracted. It is not advised to leave it untreated for long. May be since he already has abnormal liver results medications have not been prescribed for him, because many of the medicines undergo metabolism in liver. You need to consult physician before prescribing any medications to your husband. Take a decision early, consult physician and go ahead with advised treatment. Wish your husband a speedy recovery Chat Doctor."

I have been taking this Penicillin for an obsessed infected mouth tooth root for a week and about to finish it. Not totally feeling relieved by it yet. Meantime I began some swelling in my left foot and leg cafe. Hasn t gone away in the same period of fighting this infection. Can t understand if its all related or what?,"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The tooth infection can be treated by taking a course of antibiotics preferably a combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole. The reason for delay in infection healing can be diabetes or any other immunocompromised status. For the permanent relief, the cause of infection means the infected tooth has to be removed. So consult an oral maxillofacial surgeon and get it treated. Meanwhile take the course of antibiotics and get a complete hologram done. The swelling in the foot and leg is a separate condition not related to tooth infection. I hope my answer will help you, take care."

There is also possibility of infection. Instability due to increased mobility around implants may be other reason for pain.  Association between metal implants and cancer is not proven yet.

She had a heat attack with 5-way bypass 11 yrs ago and already has an ICD (defib and packmaker) implanted.   Has been very independent up until last 90 days.

If that is the case, the procedure itself would prevent the irregular and sometimes fast electrical activity from the atria from reaching the ventricles. This has the potential to improve shortness of breath that is caused by ventricles that are beating too quickly. However, your mother may also have other causes of shortness of breath that are directly related to the efficiency of the pumping function of the heart. I hope she feels better."

The infection of kidney is called pyelonephritis, and it is not easy to get it fully cured like a regular UTI.

Then you will be admitted and will start on antibiotic injections for a week, depending on the test result. Hope this discussion will be helpful to you. Thank you."

"I am 57 years old - 5 ft 9 in and have had 3 normal childbirths.  I never gained more than 25 lbs when full term.  My weight after pregnancy returned with little effort.  For at least the last 35 - 40 years my weight was never a vanity issue.  I was a size 6 easy.  However In the last 9 years I have been diagnosed with an autoimmune disease (SLE).  It has dramatically affected my activities with fatigue but my body seemed to adjust.  A year and a half ago I had a series if severe seizures and was basically very still or did no exercise as it worstened my symptoms.  About 8 months ago I just started gaining weight at a pace that I could order jeans and they would be too tight by the time I received them.  What, besides the above info can you tell me as to why I am gaining weight.  I do feel like all parts of my body are inflamed at times and it seems to be getting worse. Janet","Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The most important causes of weight gain is reduced physical activity and eating more than required. Reduced physical activity can be on account of your illness (SHE and seizures). When your lifestyle requires less physical activity, then, the food intake should also be proportionately reduced. If not, then, the weight tends to increase. In addition, the medications used for SHE such as steroids also lead to weight gain. In any case, diet control coupled with regular exercises, would lead to your weight becoming normal again. I hope it helps. Please get back if you require any further information. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. Ly/"

Results of your semen analysis reveals semen volume to be low which otherwise is within normal range of WHO standards as far as sperm count, sperm motility and morphology of sperms is concerned. Single reading of sperm count is not be taken as a final result before we label sperm count to be low. We should do semen analysis at least for three times with interval of one month and should be done in identical condition with abstinence for 3 days prior to collecting semen sample. The average of these three reading is taken into consideration before deciding status of fertility of an individual. The presence of 6-8 pus cells suggests infection either in seminal vesicle or prostate and needs to be treated with antibiotic like Doxycycline for a month. Thanks Chat Doctor."
I am a month late but the pregnancy test all say negative. I am currently recovering from a uti could that be affecting the test or my cycle at all.

And very light cramps. So i wonder if thats the pill or if the test are wrong and i am prego. I know im all over the place with this but thanks,"Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  The reasons for the delay in the period in general are anemia, and infection. You have started a new brand of the contraceptive pills, it may be the cause of the delay.  The cause if loss of apatite, mood swings, crying,light cramps, may be due to the new pills.  I advise you to consult your gynecologist for diagnosis and treatment.  Take more of green leafy vegetables, pulses, sprouts, and protein rich foods to correct anemia, and the develop resistance.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Thank you."
"I had a fall on oct 24 th 2013 and I had an injury in D12 and lower disc. My query is that for how many days it will take to do my normal routine works. 2.) Doctor has advised for an injection in my spinal cord , so my query is that the injection is necessary or not.","Hi there, welcome to Chat Doctor, thanks for your question. An injury to D12 vertebra and disc would take around 6 to 9 months to heal. But the recovery in spiral injuries depends on multiple factors like AHE of the individual (young heal earlier and elderly people heal late), the extent of injury as seen on the imaging, the healing potential of the individual (different for all of us), treatment received, amount of rest taken and use of braces. It is also important to note that disc injuries at D12 level are relatively dangerous and associated with nerve and spinal cord injuries. Injuries at this level are also associated with alignment issues in the spine. I am sure you are under follow up with spite physician or surgeon for the same. It would be prudent to continue the same and give your body adequate time to heal (6 to 9 months on an average). Hope this answers your question. All the best. Thank you. With best regards.

my 8 month old sratches his face so hard when he has wind it bleeds. he gets that worked up that he can not bring up his gas. tryed infacol / gripe water he just really struggles to get his wind up wakes all night because he is to tired to burp any tips to help his wind to stop him hurting himself,"Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to Chat Doctor.  Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief. The two best ways to relieve this distress is -1. Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved. Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer.

"I have low pain threshold. =( I ve just been diagnosed as having Pott s Disease and i am on medication . But it doesn t help with the pain and its affecting my life. I cant sleep . please help. Im really concerned with the pain as it is debilitating. Im meeting my doctor on May 2 again but as of now, i really need relief .","Hi. My name is Vinay. Am very sorry to hear about your Spine Pain. I hope you are getting all the Anti-Tubercular Medications for the treatment of the infection. That's the most important because you need to avoid further damage to the spinal column and cord. Now, as to the pain. The main thing causing the pain is the collapse of the vertebral body. When it collapses it will begin pressing against the spinal column. The only non-pharmacological treatments that are effective in this case are Physical therapy (postural therapy in particular) and core strengthening exercises. Now remember you must go to e certified therapist to attempt these exercises as you don't want to make a mistake and injure your spinal column even more. So, in effect, your best avenue for pain relief is Physical Therapy. I would call your primary doctor and get a referral for that as soon as you can. Take Care and I hope you are cured of the disease in good time without too much injury."

"Dr Doctor, I have always had a very small pea sized lump on the left side of my neck since I was young. It is not painful and has been pretty much the same size for the past 15-20 years (I am now 31). It increases in size now and again, but usually goes back to normal size. The lump also does not more. Yesterday however I was stung by a bee in the back on my neck and the pea size lump has now become very hard. I would not say overly bigger, but just very hard. I also have a little ear ache but it is not painful. Can I assume that the pea sized lump gets bigger when or if there is an infection, such as a bee sting as I received yesterday? Or should I be more concerned and go to the doctors? Your guidance would be very much appreciated. Regards Lee","Hi. You are right. It would tend to harden or increase in size or become painful in presence of any infection in that area. It is most likely to be a lymph node swelling, and it is nothing to worry about. Furthermore, it will resolve in a week or so. If it increases in size or becomes painful then you should consult your Doctor and take a course of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines. You should be fine soon. Do let us know if there are other queries that we can help you with. Take care.  Chat Doctor."

A head up tilt test would be necessary to examine for possible orthostatic hypotension which is a part of autonomic neuropathy.

Avoiding hypercaloric food would also help avoid these symptoms. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards,"

There are few possibilities in your mothers case.1. Lower respiratory tract infection (LETI)2. Chronic bronchitis.3. Pulmonary fibrosis. So get done chest x-ray to rule out LETI (pneumonia).

"Periodically I get a dizzy spell and feel I will faint. I take Lotensin and Amlodipine but, for some reason, my blood pressure drops considerably and perhaps that is when I feel faint. With meds, I average about 140s/65 but when it drops, the systolic has been as low as 50 or in the 80s. Also, what are symptoms of brain tumor If this could be relevant? My doctor has not adjusted my BP meds but I have an Appt with him next week and would like to be informed as much as possible. JR","Hello! I read your question carefully and understood your concern. In my opinion the dizzy spells and fainting are caused by a low blood pressure, which causes a low blood flow to the brain during these episodes. I don't think that there is anything to do with a brain tumor. It doesn't cause low blood pressure. I would recommend consulting with your cardiologist and have some changes in your treatment for high blood pressure. I would also recommend measuring your blood pressure during sitting position and standing up position, to see if there is any decrease in blood pressure to confirm an orthostatic hypotension which can be the cause of these problems.

I am a 27 year working women. regards, Ankita YYYY@YYYY","Hi...see acne is a hormonal concern and always happens because of that...it's not because of pollution...it's a phase of life...acne usually starts at the age of 13 to 14 and may continue till the age of 25 to 26...according to your age you should not be having a single pimple on your face but still you are getting few pimples monthly that means there might be something wrong with your hormones.acne being a hormonal concern it may recur as well but still we need to treat acne because we need to prevent complications of acne...is your MC regular,,,you can continue your isotretinoin medicine but I feel you require a proper hormonal work up...you can also try oral contraceptive pills...don't do steamroller and isotropic same time...there should be a gap of at least 4 to 6 months...continue your daily skin care like cams...cleanser toner moisturizer and sunscreen.don't worry"
"few days ago I discover some hives on several parts of my body like on my right knee, left forarm etc. because it is very itchy I applied a cortizone cream, the itch went away but after few hours it feels sore and its very painful and even before without the cream applied the hives becomes sore after few days. What causes this?","Hi, It may be lichen ultimatum most probably. There may be secondary bacterial infection due to severe scratching. Consult the dermatologist for the perfect diagnosis and proper treatment. I would recommend you to apply antibiotic cream like juridic acid cream and take a course of antibiotic for a week followed by a course of oral steroid in tapering dose. Take antihistamines till the itching subsides. Keep away yourself from insects which may be responsible for the disease. Hope this helps. Chat Doctor."

Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I understand your concern, and would like to explain that your symptoms may be related to different disorders: - cardiac related (like a supra-ventricular paroxysmal tachycardia)- a metabolic disorder (like a thyroid hormone dysfunction or a Chat Doctor. ), to find out the possible cause. An ambulatory 24 hours ECG monitoring and a cardiac ultrasound should be performed to establish the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia. Hope to have been of help! Best wishes,"

It works wonderfully well on Plasma, but it has limitations like: It cannot be used on face for more than 2-3 months for fear of causing steroid related adverse effects.

Hi!  My dad has cancer and is going through quemo for the 2nd time.  I was giving him an at home shot since he just got back from the hospital and he needs to get the meds for 10 day. I poked myself with the needle when I was capping it. What will hapen to me?,"Dear Friend. Hi, I am Chat Doctor, I have read your query in detail, I understand your concern. Infections like HIV, Hepatitis B and C can spread through needle contact injury, not cancer. You need not worry about contracting cancer. But yes, you should get your fathers HIV, Bag, Anti HCV Antibody, and in case he turns out to be positive, you would require treatment. This is my personal opinion based on details available here.

"hello doctor, IM Aparna,Age 23 ...actually im suffering with psoriasis skin disease from past 11 years ... Though now the scales are reduced but the patches of scales are still there ...patches are of black color ..can you please suggest how to reuce those patches ? that will be a gr8 help to me","Thank you for writing to us at Chat Doctor Psoriasis patches may resolve with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIN). I think that is what is concerning you at this stage. You may apply a moderately potent topical steroid e.g. fluticasone propionate cream, twice daily for a few days. This would gradually fade them away. An Oral vitamin C supplement once daily would also help with faster resolution of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Regards"

"Hello Doctor, Iam 28 year old, my height is 184cm. Last month while passing stool i had had experienced a severe hyperacidity and cramps in chest. I did following test ECG - Normal B12 - 187peg ( took 6 injection) stress test - normal Routine stool test - Normal. Iam taking Happi tablet and i am getting relieved from acidity.Sometimes i get slight pain in my chest and below chest portion.I usded to smoke but i havent smoked from last 30 days. But i eat one beetle leaf with tobbacco daily before dinner. I am little worried . I just wanna know if my symptoms are related to any kind of cancer.Looking forward to hearing from you.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. No need to worry about cancer or any major disease because you are too young for cancer. In my opinion, your symptoms are mostly due to HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). HERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause chest pain, hyperacidity etc. Smoking and tobacco are the biggest risk factors for HERD. So first quit smoking and tobacco chewing. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Take antacid like pantoprazole on empty stomach. Go for walking after meals. Don't worry, you will be alright. Don't think too much about cancer. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."
"ive been talking tetralysal for around 2 months for treatment of my skin, i stopped my pill in june as there was no need for me to be on it. i ve recently met a new partner and therefore wanted to start my Yasmin pill again. Will it be effective even though im taking the tetralysal??","Hi, No, birth control pills like Yasmin may not be effective while on betrayal. The common side effects of betrayal include vomiting, stomach upset, and diarrhea. Since Yasmin pill is a combined contraceptive pill containing both estrogen and a progestin, betrayal can reduce the efficacy of estrogen and thus an unwanted pregnancy may occur. Moreover, if you experience vomiting or diarrhea while taking betrayal this can potentially make your pill less effective at preventing pregnancy. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care"
"hi,,,i got a patient with history of bypass surgery 3 years ago for Angina. NOw he is taking daily dose of aspirin 75mg. Now he requires multiple extractions (20 teeth). As a dentist what precautions should i take and is there any need to discontinue aspirin","Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. As far the medical history is concerned, if I am your treating doctor, I would suggest you to get complete blood investigations including BT, CT, PT. I would also suggest you to get INR done. If the INR is normal then only you can go for extraction. You need to consult a cardiac physician and take an opinion. Ealiar school of thought was to stop the aspirin one day before the extraction, but now if the INR is normal, then no need to stop the aspirin. You should also take prophylactic antibiotics before extraction like amoxicillin. Get the teeth removed in multiple visits, like getting 4-5 teeth removed at a time. I hope my answer will help you, take care."

"I have lupus and fibromyalgia, and am a Cancer survivor now going on 12 years although the lupus and fibromyalgia still cause me pain everyday and my Doctor prescribes pain medication for me I was wondering since I have beenon the same medicine now going on 14 years (Lorcet Plus 7.5/650 ) iwas wondering if I might be ready to move to a stronger mg to help control my pain better?If so what do you recommend.","Hello friend, Thank you for posting your query through Chat Doctor. First let me say that I am a homoeopath, and so I will be sharing with you some different thoughts than what you have been hearing for the last so many years about your sickness. First from the short query, I understand that you had cancer. The word cancer stands for a cellular change occurred in your body some 14 years back. At that time nobody gave you these thoughts and that is why you still hold that what you had was a life-threatening event in your life, and you believe that you are saved from cancer because of the chemo therapy, radium therapy or surgery. As a Homeopath I would say that you had a shocking psychological conflict just before the development of a lump or ulcer in your body and the resolution of the conflict also happened during the course of treatment and so you survived. It was your strong will power or good mentality you developed towards your life situations that you could come back in life. That psychological resolution of your conflict made you to survive but the resection or the cancer treatment did not cure you fully and that is why you are still having pains. Now you are under the impression that there should have painkillers to control these pains. Again take from me that you are getting pains because you are not cured. I really and fully mean YOU. Pain is the language of nature that tells you that everything has not become alright. The body wants a curative treatment, but you are giving Chat Doctor. A child crying violently can be made to shut his mouth by beating him and threatening him with a stick. His cry can also be relieved by giving him stomach full of food or offering what he asks for. What your system demands now is not stronger threats and stronger sticks. YOU need a curative treatment, which so far you did not get. Nobody might have suggested you to undergo a Homeopathic treatment.  Therefore, my advice to you is to approach an expert Homeopathic physician and get the right genetic, constitutional, individualistic and curative treatment. Homeopathic cure is rapid and permanent but in your case I do not expect a sudden relief because for the last 14 years you are under strong chemical suppressive treatment for cancer and other pains. But you will be able to reduce the dosage gradually, and finally you will be able to"
"For two years now I have been experiencing pain first on my right side, which they diagnosed as diverticulitis with possible perforated bowel, which they wanted to hospitalize me for observation. No insurance so I went home on strong antibiotic s, bed rest and no food for several days. Resolved it self. ( I bleed for approximately 30 days prior to that, figured it was a very long period.) Don t said I could be starting menopause. Then I started having pain on both right and left sides and doctor put me on a regiment of antibiotic s to get the jump on any possible infections early and cut back to clear liquids until the problem passes. ( my suggestion) cause I still do not have insurance. I get extremely bloated during these times. I have noticed in the last six months that I get the same pain on the lower left side each month around the same time. (pain on the right is gone). I asked for an pelvic ultrasound to see if my ovaries are the problem. Came back Right Ovary measures 1.7x1.46x2.11 cm w/a volume of 2.74cc. The left ovary measures 2.46x1.93x2.37 cm w/a volume of 5.88cc. Please note that I had just starting taking antibiotics two days prior to this test being done due to left pain starting again. The pain last for about 3-4 days while on antibiotics and then goes away. Is it because I am taking antibiotics or because that is my normal cycle each month but I no longer have periods, haven t for about a year now. I am afraid to not take the antibiotics when I get the pain because if it is my bowels again and I do not want to put myself in the same situation I had 2 years ago. I also have trouble having bowl movements when I am having the pain as well. I have altered my diet (more fiber)...I now take a bowel medication daily to help keep my bowels normal. and about 1 week a month I feel good. The rest of the month I am bloated, cramping, and struggle to have regular bowel movements. I take blood pressure medication linsinopril (low dose) ,and a Prilosec pill daily ( which I had chronic heart burn for 2 years before I finally gave in to Prilosec verses tums. I have also had a bowel test for cancer...came back normal. Had a colonoscopy, came back diverticula present nothing alarming...some inflammation. I had just finished taking a 20 day regiment of antibiotics when I had the colonoscopy done, so I was feeling good. Should I have a C125 test done or a trans vaginal ultrasound? I really think there is something going on with my left ovary. Also my last pap showed a cyst on my uterian wall... tested no problem. My pelvis has tipped. Sex is painful. Please help where do I turn. I am tired of the routine I have been doing and I do not like the constant antibiotics every month.","Welcome to Chat Doctor. 1.

The history of bowel abnormalities during the antibiotics are normally seen in any individual.3. After going through your detail history - it seems like irritable bowel syn Chat Doctor. 4. Why CA 125 - maybe you have missed writing any ovarian pathology from your ultrasound report - as I do not see any pathology from your history.5.

For the last 2 months I have experianced palpitations on waking during the night. Sometimes they wake me up. They can last for a few hours and only normalise when I get up. I am only getting around 4 to 5 hours sleep at night. This then leads to felling light headed and feeling as if I am falling off somewhere. I am 64 and very active.,"Hello! Thank you for your question on Chat Doctor! I understand your concern and would like to explain that your symptoms may be related to a cardiac arrhythmia. Another cause to exclude are possible sleep disorders with autonomic dysfunction. I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG and some lab tests: complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, fasting glucose, blood electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests. An ambulatory 24-hour ECG monitoring would be necessary to rule in/out a possible cardiac arrhythmia. If all the above tests are normal, a polysomnography should be performed for a possible sleep disorder with autonomic dysfunction. Hope to have been of help!

The doctor said she should be fine, but others are concerned. Is this safe for her?","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, she can fly without fear.

I passed carefully through your question and would explain that your actual blood pressure values seem to be within the normal ranges. The low diastolic blood pressure could be related to atenolol intake, but these values are not concerning and there is no need for any dose adjustments. The dizziness and nausea could be related to an inner ear disorder. If these complaints persist, I would recommend consulting with an ENT specialist to exclude this possibility.

She still continues to avoid smell and flavour. How long will such symptoms last?","Hi there ~I understand your concerns for your mother.  It is not uncommon to have symptoms of anorexia with a long term illness currently under treatment with strong antibiotics.  I am sure your mother will regain the weight once she starts to have appetite for food.  Digestive enzymes may be helpful in this scenario.  I also believe that there is a lot of help out there if she does have eating disorders or symptoms of the same prior to having TB.  A visit with a psychiatrist will clear any doubts you may have regarding her eating patterns.  It is always advisable to eat in small amounts at regular intervals if mealtimes do not work.  However, it is best to see a nutritionist in case of her not gaining weight despite the best of your efforts.  I hope this helps. Take care and have a lovely day!"
"Yes! I played football from age 8 until the end of highschool. I am now almost 27. I never had a major injury but over the years my knees, lower back, and even ankles have progressively hurt worse and worse, especially my knees and back. I do landscaping work so it s always hard on my body. I take Advil Ibuprofen and Aleve but it doesn t work. Honestly the only times I have had the pain go away is taking painkillers? What is your suggestion?","Hi, The history sounds more towards having the muscle weakness of the back. You need to do regular exercise for your core to stabilize the spine. Also going swimming on weekly once should provide some more additional overall stability of spine. For knee, you need to focus more on stability exercises. I will recommend using the balance board for various benefits to the knee joints. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor."

It seems your kid is having viral diarrhea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics (LIKE FLAGYL OR GRAMMY) unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhea.

It is a progesterone hormone like Chat Doctor. If you have been trying for a year and not successful, you should get thoroughly evaluated, which would include, Sperm count, hormonal levels, ultrasound pelvis, and an HSG of the tubes. Since you have irregular cycles it indicates an ovulation (difficulty in egg formation). You and your partner need to discuss all this with your gynecologist and decide further treatment. Hope this helps. Regards."

Hello doctor. I got the paragard IUD inserted a couple of weeks ago and for about a week I was getting severe cramps but the cramps stopped for a couple of days. Then all of a sudden I started to get random spasms of awful pain in my tailbone that lasted about a week and a half. The pain is not as awful now but I still have some pain every now and then. Is this something I should worry about? I m wondering if this has nothing to do with the IUD and if I should get it checked out. Thank you,"Hello, Your symptoms do not seem to be related to the IUD. Anyway, I would recommend performing an abdominal ultrasound in order to check it. I would also recommend performing a sacral X-ray study and some blood lab tests (complete blood count, PCR, ESR for inflammation). You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Wishing all the best."

Welcome to Chat Doctor. I read your query. Metronome is actually a hormonal therapy used for blood cancer in post menopausal women. Among its other effects are vaginal bleeding and gum bleeding. You need to consult your physician if you can have some change in medicine (which is highly unlikely). Maintain good oral hygiene. Brush twice daily using extra soft brush and toothpaste with tannin acid. Take healthy diet with iron, vitamin C. Ask your physician for multivitamin and mineral supplants for you. Use mouthwash twice a day. Rinse well after eating. Visit your dentist every 3-6 months and get oral prophylaxis regularly. Massage gums with a mild gum paint or mustard oil for healthy circulation.

"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here.  .. my friend has diffuclty in breathing in past he had asma now thats getting better but still has difficult breathing doctors said has enlargment of nasal cartilages and gave him cortisone injection once every 3 months i want to know wether this treatment is right and whats the side effects of cortisone?","Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your friends history and would like to know more about him like - what is his age? Since what age did he have asthma? What is the frequency of his asthma symptoms? What are his nose symptoms - nasal congestion, running nose, sneezing, etc.? Does he have headaches or facial pains? Does he have recurrent throat problems? Does he have any other medical condition? Does he smoke or is he exposed to air pollution/dusts/smoke? From your given history, I would like to make following suggestions for him:1. Were I treating him, I would suggest him regular montelukast. In addition to that, inhalers and nasal sprays can be decided after knowing his symptoms in detail.2. I would suggest him allergy testing which will help him to know the substances causing troubles to him and also to know how to avoid them. Based on the report, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe him allergen specific immunotherapy which may work on his immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms.3. I would also suggest him regular breathing exercises and avoidance of smokes/dusts/air pollution as much as possible.4. A healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc.) will also help him in a long run.5. Regarding side effects of cortisone, it is a corticosteroid. So prolonged, repeated use can cause many side effects like gastritis, hypertension, diabetes, weight gain, cataract, glaucoma, etc. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to him. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish your friend the best of the health. Thank you & Regards."

"Hi there, I am currently experience chronic, uncomfortable itchyness around my genital area. It first started with that I thought was thrush, so I got an over-the counter medicine for that. But I found the creams releaved my itchyness only periodically and stung a little when applied. As this has kept going, I have developed a rash around my pubic mound - looks like a lot of pimples / ingrown hairs which have become more and more itchy as it grows. I also have noticed that the skin becomes flaky and peels off. I have a little more discharge than usual, but havent noticed an abnormal smell.","Hi there, i think things are not very clear and of course it's not possible for you to tell each and everything in detail. Now there are two things in mind as I gathered according to your condition,1:IT could have been a Yeast infection and the cream that you have bought over the counter may contain steroids and after the application there is a steroid induced acne, which you have referred as """"lots of pimples"""". So if that is the case then you need to stop the cream.2:You might have developed a condition called Lichen Simplex Chronic us in which the skin becomes thickened, Chat Doctor. At this point I think you need to see a doctor so that he can have a good look at the rash and associated factors and proceed further. The only advise I would like to give you is to apply White Petroleum Jelly at the sites regularly and take Tablet Zyrtec 10 mg once a day before going to bed. Thanks very much, and all the set."
I had a gall bladder attack before a month and i went to emergency.i had multiple very smal stones and sludge.I took udiliv for 3 weeks and had diet restriction so now i have multiple stones with the largest size of 5 mm and there is no sludge.My surgeon asked me to go for a laproscpy but im taking udilive and maintaining a healthy lifestyle which i was not doing before.Can i expect not to have surgery and dissolve my gall stone?or you think even if it dissolves it will come back?please help.thanku,"Hi.noted history of gallstones with intake of medications. In early stages of gallstone formation, it is possible for the sludge or smaller stones to dissolve with the medication intake. But if It's already big and is numerous, the chance for it to dissolve is less, causing the symptoms to ensue despite medication intake. If the symptoms are bothersome, persistent, or increasing in frequency of occurrence, it is best to consult with a doctor with urgency, preferably a general surgeon, for physical examination and clinical evaluation. Diagnostics (such as repeat ultrasound, blood count, liver function tests, etc.) and management (medical and surgical) will be directed accordingly. Cholecystectomy (surgical removal of the gallbladder) is the definitive treatment, which could be done laparoscopically (gold standard) or through open technique. Low fat diet is also recommended.

"I had a renal transplant 2 yrs ago. I had a marina coil in place at the time of my transplant and recently had it changed to a new one. I have had a vaginal irritation and discharge ever since. My doctors have swabbed me twice and cannot identify the reason for the discharge and irritation, could this be caused by the marina?","Hello, Thanks for writing in. The fact that you had marina coil earlier too and got it replaced rules out any adverse reaction to the coil itself. You could also get an ultrasound scan to be sure that the coil is in place. Since you have had kidney transplant, your immunity may be little weaker than in normal individuals. Fungal infections are not picked up on routine sexually transmitted infection tests. This can result in fungal infection in your vagina which is causing the irritation. I suggest you apply some antifungal medication as suggested by your gynecologist. Hope this helps."

"Hi , I suffer from sebaceous cyst which is on my cheek,, I have 3 there at moment and all doctors seen to give me cream with antibiotic, , my cheek is all swelled up at moment and very painfull should all of them be removed at same time, so they dont come back,, and the scaring it leaves is really getting me down and the appearance it leaves on my face,, im a girl and isnt nice to hav the scars,, is there anything I could have done for all the scars its leaving ?","Hi. Are you sure they are sebaceous cysts and not acne eruptions which have become infected? I suggest you see a Dermatologist and you would require some antibiotic tablets or capsules for a week to ten days as they sound like infected and should not be removed during active infection. If the Dermatologist says its Sebaceous cyst then you will require removal. For least scarring you can see a Plastic Surgeon. If he says it is acne then the treatment is different, and he would guide you accordingly and surgery can be avoided. Do let us know if we can help you with any other queries. Take care, Chat Doctor."
I have had 3 vertebral subluxations from an accident in 2001. I am wondering if the pain I have experiencing more and more is considered chronic or not. I have not had any help with it for years and it seems it s getting worse. I don t want to take pain pills for it either,"Hello ! I understand your concern! If I were your doctor I would recommend a new column MRI to find out if the subluxations are at the same point or have revoluted. Holding a brace would be very helpful. Postural education, physiotherapy, avoiding sitting positions for a long time, or holding heavy things would also be helpful. I would also recommend Amitriptyline, an antidepressant Chat Doctor.  You must be careful if starting this therapy to have a cardio logic consultation as it has heart side effects. Another choice of therapy would be Gabapentin or Pregabalin, two antiepilepsy"

"My niece was prescribed tramadol 50mg and double dosed some 5 days ago. About 30 min. later she had a tonic-clonic seizure and we know now that the tramadol can bring on seizures,but she is still having the body twitches and feels the same way she did that morning after taking the tramadol. Also wondering if percocet can bring on seizures and if perhaps she had a seizure due to withdrawals since she did without her meds for awhile.","Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Tramadol is known to cause seizures. This is more common with tramadol injections and high dose tramadol treatments. The muscle twitches are not of much concern, and they are not suggestive of or related to seizures. In the future, it is better to avoid tramadol for pain relief. Percent is fine and quite safe for her. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, Chat Doctor.

I am eight weeks pregnant. I had a previous history of one abortion. My gynaecologist advised me Duphaston tablet twice a day and it was going okay. Today I got light spotting and she advised me Fertigyn Injection once a week for four weeks. Whether it is safe for the growing baby?,"Hi, Yes, it can be used safely during pregnancy. Based on the history you seem to have symptoms suggestive of a missed abortion for which your doctor advised foreign injections. Fertigyn actually contains human chorionic gonadotropin which helps to support and maintain a normal pregnancy and during early pregnancy it is useful in preventing miscarriage as well. It is considered to be safe for the growing baby. Continue to take it as prescribed. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further."
I inject myself with 17.5 mg of methotrexate once a week for psoriatic arthritis. My doctor x-rayed and diagnosed me with pneumonia. He prescribed amoxicillin/clavulanic acid oral to start tomorrow. The drugstore information flyer says a bad interaction can occur with these two drugs. My doctor may have forgotten my rheumatologist has me on methotrexate. What should I do?,"Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Amoxicillin plain can interact with methotrexate and so antibiotic effect is reduced. But when amoxicillin is given in combination with clavulinic acid, it is not interacting with methotrexate and hence antibacterial effect don't hamper. So you should continue amoxicillin plus clavulinic acid for pneumonia. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."

hi i would like to know if i missed a birth control pill and didn t take it and had unprotected sex can i be pregnant and how long after will i start getting symptoms if i am?hi i would like to know when i missed a contraceptive pill and didnt take it and had unprotected sex with my husband can i be pregnant and if so how long before i start getting symptoms?,"Hi, Thank you for posting your question here I will try to answer it to the best of my abilities. Yes, there is a possibility of getting pregnant if you miss your contraceptive pill and have unprotected sex. Wait around 7-10 days and then take a home pregnancy test, that should give you your result. Alternatively you can go to a doctor and ask him to test your blood to check if you are pregnant. Another thing you can do is call up your doctor and ask them to prescribe you with emergency pills that work for up to 5 days after unprotected sex, for example ulipristal acetate. So if it has been less than 5 days since the incident, I believe that would be the best option for you. I hope this answered your question."

"For the first time in my life I got a cold/oral herpes. My lymph nodes are very tender and swollen under my jawline. The pain is radiating to my right ear and I have a bad headache with eye pain. I have weird sensations on the right side of my face.I also noticed a red tender spot on the the sole of my feet. I also have a high Rh factor and positive ANA since last year. So something is going on with my immunity. My doctor prescribed me Valtrex but I couldn t afford right now, maybe I can have my MD call in something cheaper. Do I need to worry that this will turn into viral meningitis? How did I catch this oral herpes? My roommate had it last week. Could I have gotten it from her from sharing utensils and stuff. I am 30 yrs old female And never ever had this in my life. my friends tell me most ppl have the virus in their bodies, it comes out during stress. I was under intense stress before and never had this happen to me. Plus I had a blood test to check for herpes and other stuff two years ago and it was negative. I am really confused on how I could have gotten this. I haven t kissed anyone, my husband and I have been separated for months. I need some good advice on what to do, how I could have gotten this virus, and now that I have how do I prevent it? Thank you","Hioral herpes is due to virus infection contracted from any source not necessarily through oral contact with others or utensils. Proneness to virus infections is known with lower immunity status for whatever cause, and susceptibility is more during low body immunity, severe stress, poor health and opportunistic infection in chronic ill patients due to tuberculosis, cancers. But do not worry, the modern medicines are available, like antivirals, biologics, autoimmune Chat Doctor. For lymph nodes if painful, anti-inflammatory medicines may be prescribed by your physician as well as other medications for herpes-it takes 10-21 days to subside, but does get controlled, so do not worry be in touch with a physician best wishes"

"I m a 31 year old lady , got married at the age of 30. was diagnosed with PCOS sometime last year, with one blocked fallopian tube . was placed on some hormonal drugs like duphastone, progesterone pills etc to regulate my periods and achieve pregnancy but it i soon gave up on that when i dint get the desired result after 7months. I started taking m2 tone afterwards, saw my period after taking it for a month, 2 tablets, 3 times daily., later combined it with clomid on the 3rd day of my cycle, althought the flow was very light, it lasted for 8 days. the second months passed on , still on m2 tone with clomid after i saw my period. this is the third month now, i have missed my period which was due on the 5th of this month,i went for a pregancy test today , the result showed that am not pregnant,. even with my missed period. I am so confused now, i dont know what to do, should i continue the m2 tone or stop the medication? I combine the m2 tone with folic acid , that is taken once a day. Please i need your candid advise, on this. I need to start having kids as soon as possible. Thanks. Doris.","Hi Doris Welcome to Chat Doctor As you told you have PCs and one fallopian tube is also blocked. PCs is a common problem among women which leads to infertility. Every month only one egg comes out of the ovary and available for fertilization, but you can't predict which side ovary will ovulate. As you told one side tube is blocked and if ovulation occurs that side only then chances of pregnancy will be very low. You need to undergo follicular monitoring (By ultrasound) to see growth of egg and side of ovulation. If ovulation is occurring from favorable side then there is chance of pregnancy. As you have PCs I would suggest you to undergo certain hormonal tests like LH, FSH, Testosterone, RHEAS (Also s.prolactin n TSH) etc. And if there is disturbance of hormones then it needs to be treated accordingly. You have not mentioned your age and weight. I would suggest you to lose weight if you are overweight by diet control and exercise. Get your blood sugar checked as it also has adverse effect on fertility. M2 tone and folic acid can be continued. You need to take tab camphene to induce ovulation, do follicular monitoring to see growth of egg and side of ovulation and then try by timed intercourse or GUI. Take care"
hi I started with my period on 18-Jan-14 and I got my pregnancy test done on 23-Feb-14 it came negative then I hade meprate medicine on 25-Feb till 1st of March .I just want to known when you dont no about pregnancy and you take this medicine will it harmfull if I am pregnant.,"Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion me prate is not suggested to take during pregnancy. If the lady is on me prate and pregnancy is accidentally detected then the me prate is stopped. Meprate is associated with genetic abnormalities in fetus. But of course there is no clear indication of damage caused by it. Your doctor might have prescribed only after the pregnancy is 100% ruled out. If you were pregnant the urine pregnancy test would have been positive. If you still want to confirm blood BChatDoctor test can be done to check for pregnancy. But any doctor prescribes it only after confirming the absence of pregnancy. So relax. Hope this helps.

I am taking Ativan, Zoloft, tramadol, methotrexate (for last 2 months), hydroxycloriquine.","Welcome in Chat Doctor. I understand your query as you said you are a follow-up patient of rectal cancer and having sound while breathing. Here I would like to say that unwanted breathing sounds are produced whenever there is either swelling, phlegm or obstruction in airway. Whenever these sounds are heard only during sleeping hours we call it as snoring. As a rule all above may be either in nose or throat. Different clinical conditions may be-1- Deviated nasal septum.2- Chronic Maxillary sinusitis.3- Nasal polyps.4- Turbinate hypertrophy.5- Thick and slag soft palate.6- Short neck with double chin.7- Loose para pharyngeal soft tissue.

"Hi, my name is Camilla, I would like to know of any alternative to mirtazapine, as I am gaining too much weight from it. It has to be something that works as good as mirtazapine in order to get a good night sleep, since my depression symptoms really triggers this. Bst rgds Camilla","Hi Camilla, Mirtazapine is an effective anti-depressant with sedation and increase in weight as its significant side effects. As an antidepressant, there are many alternatives to mirtazapine. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like Escitalopram, sertraline, etc. are effective and safe. It causes lesser weight gain than mirtazapine but is not as effective sedative. Bupropion has the least association with weight gain. However, is also not sedating. As you have mentioned that your sleep problems are triggered by depression, I think starting these anti-depressants with short term sedatives will solve your problem. Sedating anti-depressants include agomelatine and tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline. Tricyclics also cause weight gain and also have much more side effects. I do hope this information was useful. You can discuss these Chat Doctor. Best wishes."

You will ovulate around 13 to 14th day of cycle. You can try some medicines like camphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles' growth by repeated ultrasound.  When follicles reach a size more than 17 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for next 2 to 3 days.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months.  Hope I have answered your question.  If you have any other query I will be happy to help.

I have a normal egg reserves and the Dr want to put me on birth control before he does the procedures with a saline irrigation, biopsy, and the dye (i think to check the fillopian tubes). Why is it necessary to put me on birth control before my first IUI prodecure?","Hi, I guess your concern is about is it necessary to put you on birth control before your GUI procedure. Well you missed one information to share with us, about menses. So whether your menses is regular or not? Without this information my answer of your question is 50% NO and 50% YES. I can justify for this 50%. If menses are regular then no need to be on birth control. If menses are not regular then it is really necessary to put on birth control. GUI is done around the ovulation (ovulation means the period during which dominant follicle is rupture and ovum is released). Sperm in GUI needs to fertilize this ovum to getting pregnant. If menses are not regular then ovulation can not be predicted, GUI will be not successful. As you have not provided the info about menses, I can't give you pinpoint answer. I guess this was informative enough, useful and helpful for query-is it put on birth control before GUI procedure. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
Hi I am using Formonide 400 inhaler.. I heard that once I start this i wont be able to stop . Is it correct?My uncle started with Asthalin and now he is using formonide.. For me my doctor gave me formonide for breathing difficulty coz of high allergy,"Hi welcome to ChatDoctorit is not correct that once you start inhaler you won't be able to stop the main idea of prescribing inhaled medications is - low dose medications could be used when compared to oral medication which have many side effects though the later are cheaper, and secondly the site of action of medications will be in lung itself regarding your query your uncle might be initially having intermittent asthma later on when it got converted to persistent asthma he might have been prescribed on phoronid.

For most of this afternoon it has risen to 203/100 down a little bit to 165/79 and then back up again to 190 and now 203/93 again.   Mum is taking 50gm minax a day as well as aspirin & crestor. She also has vascular dementia with underlying alz and is 82 years old.  Should i be taking her to the hospital?","Hello, the blood pressure reading you have mentioned are considered high. The vascular dementia can be explained by her not so well controlled blood pressure in the past. A visit to her doctor, so that he can essentially adjust his blood pressure medication and if needed maybe increase it would surely help in preventing any future major complication, by all means it would be better if hr blood pressure is kept below 140 / 90 .

Thus, low white blood cells are not caused by sickle cell trait. Low white blood cell counts are seen in cases of bone marrow depression or in cases of severe infections. Other blood parameters also have to be assessed to determine the cause of low white blood cell counts.

In case of any food accumulation proper rinsing should be followed. Do this for a week religiously for the child and see if it helps. In case of persistence of symptoms please see your dentist. Do not get worried if there is mild bleeding upon while brushing. It should be alarming only when there is continuous oozing of blood. Bleeding while brushing will be considered normal in gingivitis. Hope it helps. Let me know for further help. Thanks. Take care."

The only medication I am on is phentermine 1/2 cap which equals about 18 mg. per day. I had an injury to the hip area, causing bursitis which I am getting physical therapy for. These new symptoms seem something to be concerned about. Your thoughts...","Hi, Thank you for posting your query.First, I would like to reassure you that the new symptoms are not something to get concerned about. However, they require evaluation to find out the cause and start treatment. We need to do a glucose tolerance test to exclude impaired glucose tolerance. The severity of peripheral neuropathy can be assessed by a clinical examination and nerve conduction studies. You may benefit from pregabalin capsules to relieve the neuropathy symptoms, and vitamins such as B12 and folate may help in nerve healing. I hope it helps.

"I cannot breathe at night if I ingest casein, peanut products, almonds, or soy products. I m wondering if this problem is related to non-alergic sensitivity to these foods or is it related to inflammatory response? How to overcome? I use a CPAP machine... I also use Triamsinalone corticosteroid possibly linked to glaucoma which I want to avoid using and I also use another nasal Spray... can t rememaber its name off-hand... --Bill--","You are an allergic person as you are using nasal spray I suppose. The difficulty in breathing that you describe after ingestion of certain food products can be due to your allergy and lead to an asthma attack sometimes.However, you are on triamcinolone steroids that would be the treatment for any allergic disease but for an instant relief it won't help and hence you need to use an inhaler that provides instant relief.

Staph and strep are the 2 diseases that can spread from it, so it is very important to start treatment right away. Good luck!"

The bruise stopped hurting pretty quickly like any other bruise but the area where the bruise was turned smushy as if it were like a blister or if there was liquid inside.

"five days after having my wisdom teeth surgically removed, im experiencing a lot of soreness in my tongue and jaw. what can i do to relieve this? ive used both heat and ice, and ive been taking ibuprofen and prescription tylenol with codeine, none of which seem to help.","Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The soreness in the tongue could be because of the ulcer that formed by biting on the teeth when it was numb. The soreness in the jaw could be because of the bone cutting during extraction of wisdom tooth. Nothing to worry, it will subside in 2 days. You can take an analgesic with anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  Do saline gargling. Consult an oral maxillofacial surgeon if the pain does not subside within 7 days after extraction. I hope my answer will help you, take care."
"Question My 6 month old son has a naval point which is leaking a liquid which dries out to a white colour. The problem has persisted for 3 weeks and the baby has already been treated for infection with an antibiotic, but this did not help. Presently suspected is gall bladder complications. The general condition of the baby is normal except for this liquid coming out of his umbilical cord. Your advise on this will be very helpful.","Good morning my dear ---your son most likely has a connection which was present in the embryo which normally closes but can persist sometimes. This is called the omphalomesentric duct ----it can be a sinus, a cyst or a fistula---can be in connection with any internal organ and can sometimes contain a lining similar to stomach or intestine. Best is to check wit a pediatric surgeon who will make some ultrasound images and may give relief by surgically excising the connection. Antibiotics alone may not heal and there will be recurrent discharge from the site."

My question is that is there are side effects of oxygen or injections . And is there proper treatment of disease like that. One said that her respiration pipe dont know what it called is getting shrinkage and when giving oxygen so it becomes better. Please advise me .. She is in great pain. Thanks and regards, Habib","Hello Habit, Asthma is caused due to bronchoconstriction (obstruction of smaller airway passages) which is indicative of Hyper-responsiveness of air passages. Management consists of:1. Oxygen inhalation, bronchodilators and corticosteroids - provide symptomatic relief during acute attack by causing bronchodilator (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs)2. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy.3. Antihistamines can also be used to provide symptomatic relief.4. Protection from exposure to cold, dust or other allergens. Though prolonged use of steroid injections have its side effects, the risk-benefit ratio should be taken into consideration before administering them. Presence of pain during coughing or deep breathing can be attributed to either fatigue of respiratory muscles due to labored breathing or due to infection. Investigation like X-ray of the chest will be helpful in clinching the diagnosis. If symptoms still persist, it will be better to consult a Pulmonologist & get a proper physical examination done. So that appropriate management steps could be taken. Please let me know if you have any further queries.

Treatment of pneumonia should be guided according to the causative organism.

"Sir My father has a very very littlie sings of cancer but after consultation with the doctor he said everthing is ok but after getting exemine she said that i have same DOUBT  in your cheeks and suggested to go for chemotheraphy and assurerd he will be all right after 2 doses, so kindly suggest me that what action i should take","Hi, Thanks for writing in. Cancer is an important condition and chemotherapy should be given only after confirmation. Please tell your father to visit a cancer hospital and then get examined in detail. If there is doubt then please have imaging investigation and biopsy done. It is best to clarify even the smallest doubt of cancer before taking chemotherapy. Without confirmation no one should take chemotherapy as it can cause serious side effects and damage. First he should get a CT scan or MRI scan done and then a biopsy. In this way the cells from cheeks will be studied under microscope and any abnormal cancer cells picked up. There is usually no doubt in finding a cancer on biopsy. If not conclusive then a repeat biopsy is to be done. Doing a PET scan is advised if doubt persists and this tells a cancer in most cases. Please do not worry."

But for now, what happens when it is gone, if that is what he decides.","Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. No food restriction after surgery for gall bladder is usually necessary. Days with excess fat content, mild diarrhea, might happen.2. Ultrasound of abdomen will help in confirmation of any gallbladder flare up.3. If the polyps are causing any obstruction, serum alkaline phosphatase and indirect bilirubin levels will also be elevated along with pale stools.4. Not to worry, mild fat malabsorption might occur.

"My wife is a 64 year old with an apparent pinched nerve in the mid back which is causing hip pain.  She has taken Excedrin and ibuprofin with little result.  I suggested hydrocodone , but she is concerned that it might cause atrial fibrillation.  Is this pain killer not indicated?","Atrial fibrillation is an arrhythmia characterized by rapid, uncoordinated electrical activity and an irregularly irregular heart response. Medications are usually not a cause of atrial fibrillation unless they cause an electrolyte abnormality. Generally A. Fib. Is caused by hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, obesity, and lung disease. Alcohol and caffeine, as well as hyperthyroidism and diabetes have also been associated with A. Fib. Therefore, to reduce your risk of atrial fibrillation, you should adequate control your blood pressure, loss weight, and avoid alcohol. I would not recommend HY Chat Doctor.  Your best option is to find a primary care doctor that can do any injection into the hip. The injection will relieve the pain, associated swelling, and hopefully the pinched nerve. In the meantime, I would continue ibuprofen and Tylenol. Also, rest and ice will help."

"Good evening, I had prostate radiation treatments for 44 days from December, 2013 through February, 2014. My PSA test three months later showed no trace of cancer cells remaining. However, I continue to have excess fluids in my legs, ankles, feet, thighs, etc. I also had a six-month injection of Lupron in October of 2014 prior to beginning radiation treatment. Is there anything I can do to reduce the excess fluid in my body? Thank you for the courtesy of a reply. David","Hi, Thanks for writing in. Collection of fluid following radiation treatment is seen after radiation treatment in many patients. Collection of fluid in the soft tissues of legs is known as pedal edema and can be seen in people having problems with heart or lungs or those with excessive fluid retention following cancer treatment. This happens due to the collection of water in the extracellular compartment in soft tissues below the skin. It will help to consult your oncologist and then get a prescription of water pills. These will allow the extra water to be diverted to the vascular compartment and then excreted through the kidneys. This is a temporary phase and completely treatable. Please do not worry."

He has subsequently been transferred to rehab and put on oral Levaquin.  Concern is that he may possibly have leukemia because white count isnt coming down.,"Hi and thank you so much for this query. I am so sorry to hear about this high white cell count and the pneumonia that your father has. A high cell a lone is not very suggestive. Leukemia would present with abnormal cells that would have raised this suspicion. Because this was identified in the context of an infection, it makes sense to think it is related to the infection and not otherwise. If reasons to remain to suspect it after the treatment, then the doctors would consider that. A count of 39000 seems not too alarming for the infection he has. Let's monitor again to see whether it remains that high. I hope this ad Chat Doctor.  If you have more related questions, feel free to ask me and I will gladly add"
"My tongue hurts really bad. I used an inhaler the other day that i have never used before. The next day i woke up and my tongue was in a lot of pain (almost as if i burnt it). I looked in the mirror and my tongue had an extreme amount of white stuff on it (looked simillar to plaque but i was unable to brush it all off) Now days after, the white stuff is gone but my tongu and gums are very sensitive. It almost feels like my whole tongue is raw. I need help please!!!!","Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your query white coating over the tongue after using inhaler that might be containing Steroid can be due to Yeast infection over the tongue known as Oral Thrush. It can cause inflammation of tongue and gums leading to pain and soreness. As the white coating is gone that means infection is resolving there can still be inflammation of tongue and gums leading to pain and soreness. Nothing to worry, start gargling with Statin mouthwash to resolve the residual infection. Gargle with numbing mouthwash containing Lidocaine. Take vitamin B complex supplements daily. Suck ice pops and do cold water rinses.in case of no improvement consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor."
Hello Doctor! Recently i came to know that im having low thyroid and hig chloestrol.i dont eat much fatty foods its genetic.I took Levothyroxine tab 50mg for 1 month and after that got my test done showing report as thyroid levels are normal.But ive noticed that im lossing my hair alot.Doctor prescribed me  to take thyroid medicine for 3 months and after 3 mobths to check again my thyroid levels.My question is do i need to take this medication for life long?what to do with hair loss prb?Plz reply with details asap.Thanks,"Hello and welcome to ChatDoctorSince you do have a thyroid problem, this could be the main cause of hair fall. Do continue the treatment as advised. You may most probably have to continue this life long to keep the levels in normal range. This will also help your skin and hair. Other causes to consider are age, genetic, any lifestyle or residence change, stress, any history of recent illness like typhoid, any chemical procedures, etc. You can start on supplements daily like Collinear. This needs to be continued at least for 2-3 months along with proper thyroid medication. Apply Recite hair oil to the scalp at night. Do consult a dermatologist as well, to assess your type of hair loss and to assess the results. They may also suggest some routine blood tests if required. Once your hormonal levels are normal you will notice improvement in hair growth as well, but it will take time. If medical methods do not work at all for you, certain new surgical procedures can be considered such as PRP.hair transplant etc., as will be advised by your consulting doctor after observation, if and when required. Hope this helps."

"Hi,I have been taking minygynon birth control for a month. I usually take the pill at 12-1 am each morning. however i had unprotected sex before taking my pill one morning..hence..i took the pill around 12pm the same day. is it a possibility that i could get pregnant?","Hi, If you have been regular with your pill, you are almost safe from conception and more so if you are in the safe period of an ordinary menstrual cycle. Since you have also taken the pill, you are doubly protected. So, please do not worry about failure of contraception. Only, watch out for your next normal period as it may get delayed by a week or two and also, you may see some with Chat Doctor.  Please see a specialist if you do not see your next period even after 10-14 days after it is due, for further management. Hope this helps."
"I have increasingly been having lots of mucus in the back of my throat and also a sort of heartburn after I lie down at night. I cough several times during the day as well. When i spit out the mucus, it often makes me gag. This aspect is fairly recent. I am 72 and otherwise in great health. What should I take for this? Also, could this be due to eating certain foods that no longer agree with me? Thank you. Elizabeth RIver","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Chronic acid reflux can cause micro aspiration and coughing. Since your coughing is more in your night after lying down, possibility of acid reflux related coughing is more likely. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief.1. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food.2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.3. Take pantoprazole and levosulperide combination twice daily on empty stomach.4. Go for walking after meals.5. Avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm.6. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux.7. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits.Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."

"Hello, I have a question/concern about a sexual encounter with my girlfriend. And as far as I know we are in a monagomus relationship. First I want to point out that we live in different states. Last time I was back home in May we had sex a number of times until the end of May when I had to return to school. In the past weeks I have had stomach cramps and within the last week I noticed a discomfort on the skin near the top of my penis. I looked closer and it was a red bump and flesh colored. The next day it oozed a clear liquid but only when I squeezed the area. It appears to be healing but no golden crust formed. This bump burns and still gives me discomfort to date. Is this a sign of herpes? I read that the incubation period is 2 to 30 days with 21 days being the average. Since my last possible exposure is it possible that I could have acquired the infection and that could be an outbreak even though it has been almost 2 months?

Blood work showed elevated Liver enzymes...low 100 s. Pain continues to be interrmittent. Does not go thru to the back. No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.. No major weight loss. All vital signs normal. I had CT with contrast of the abdomen which is normal (small fatty infiltrate of liver). PMH: Endometral CA (had hysterectomy), DM Type II, Thyroidectomy (non-cancer). My question is....could this be pancreatic cancer?? I am not seeing the symptoms, but I am concerned..or if not ... what??... where do I go from here?","Hi.noted history of RUN pain and existing co-morbidities. It is possible that you have a gallstone disease. It could also be any pathology somewhere along your hepaticopancreaticobiliary tree area. It is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a gastroenterologist or a general surgeon, for physical examination and clinical evaluation. Other diagnostics (such as pancreatic enzymes, liver function tests, blood count, etc.) and management (medical and/or surgical if indications are found) will be directed accordingly. If it is indeed of gallstone in etiology, definitive treatment is surgical removal of the gallbladder or cholecystectomy. It can be done laparoscopically (gold standard) or through open technique. Low fat diet is also advised. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor."

I had a steriod injection two months ago, I had a major rash that burned on the skin. It went away a month ago but now my elbow hurts twice as bad.","Hello, The symptoms seem to be related to a pain in the elbow due to overuse. I suggest icing the elbow to reduce pain and swelling for 20 to 30 minutes every 3 to 4 hours for 2 to 3 days or until the pain is gone.

yes i have been taking this medicine jantoven since 2009 and this medicine is not working well with me my levels are always 1.02 to 1.06 i had a mitral valve replace a ticker and when i walk a good distant i get sick and vomits and sweat out of control,"Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for writing to us. From the history it is evident THT you had a mitral valve replacement few years back, and now you are on CANTON(WARFARIN SODIUM). You have also, mentioned your INR level between 1.02 to 1.06.  As per the recommendation, the INR level in a post mitral valve replacement pt should lie between 2.5 to 3.5,low INR level signifies risk of :1. Bleeding from different sites such as gum, nose, per rectum etc2.fatigue, respiratory distress and dizziness.3.sweating, vomiting etc. so, as per the recommendation your dose of CANTON should be increased, so that the INR lies between 2.5 to 3.5,following that your problems will get automatically sorted out.

I completed that 5 day course but she had lot of loose motions and vomits. Now, doctor has given cepodem-xp for another 5 days. Is it recommeneded.","Hi...the diarrhea or loose stools your kid is having might be due to the initial antibiotic, and I suspect that it could be antibiotic associated diarrhea. The other issue which I feel is that what your kid is having is not infection - it is allergy related wheezing. I feel what your kid could be having viral associated wheeze or multi triggered wheeze. I have a few questions for you -Questions:1. How many days per month does she cough or feel breathless?2. How many nights per month does her sleep get disturbed due to above symptoms?3. Does she feel breathless when she runs around or plays with other kids?4. Are the symptoms when there are seasonal changes?5. Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?6. Is the cough always associated with fever? If your answer is yes for any of the above questions, your kid might be having viral associated wheezing or multi triggered wheezing, and I suggest you meet a pediatric pulmonologist who is near your place. No point in using antibiotics every time. It will do more harm than good by increasing bacterial resistance. Regards -"
"Hi, I m a 24 year old female I weigh 130 pounds and I m 5 6 with severe lower back pain and frequent migraines. October 2009 I found out I had a nodule located on my thyroid which a biopsy proved inconclusive to being malignant or benign. So my doctors decided to do a surgery removing only the left side of my thyroid due to the location of the nodule. Results from that surgery proved to be malignant hurthle cell carcinoma. 4 months after that surgery I underwent a total thyroidectomy and also had 7 lymph nodes removed due to calcification. For a few months following that I lost my voice randomly and developed nodules on my vocal cords from what they said was the endotrachael tube and had to see a speech therapist. I also had a calcium drop from 10.1 (pre-surgery) to 8.4(post-surgery) consistently. 6 months after my second surgery I took the radioactive iodine and then did the body scan. Although the doctors said it turned out good I was told there was supposed to be 0 traces of iodine in my system with the exception of my thyroid. I did the scan 4 days after swallowing the iodine and the scan showed it in my bladder and kidneys. is this due to just being excreted? And if so is that normal for 4 days after the scan? Also I did a thyroglobulin test that i was told was supposed to be 0 and it was .6, could this be significant? All that was specifially to ask this, A few months after the treatment I started developing lower back pain, when I saw my endocrinologist I informed him of it but since I was having a hard time adjusting to the proper dosage of snythroid(for a 3 month period I was hypothyroid) he convinced me I was just achy and having body pains due to being hypo. For 4 months now I have been pretty much within normal ranges on my TSH and FT4 but my back pain won t go away. Even just standing for 20 minutes or more causes horrible pain if I have to bend over or sit down or move positions. It almost takes me breathe away. Could this be my calcium change? Or possible cancer in the bone? Or is it possible for your vertebreas to fuse together? HELP ME",As mentioned in your narrative you have got rid with just a muscle spasm nothing else. For this you have to take some painkiller with muscle relaxant like tab danger or tab osteopath after meals when your back pain is worse enough to disturb your routine work along with tab shall 500 mg once daily preferably in afternoon with tab rant ac or tab carotid empty stomach.

My doctor gave me fertility drug clomid which I tried but yet am not pregnant.Also after sex  I always experience flowback of semen which always give me concern on my journey to getting pregnant.Please, doctors in the house what can I do to increase my chance of getting pregnant?Thanks.","Hi, Firstly, please do not lose hope as POD is a condition that responds very well to treatment. It is needed to have a complete investigation to gauge the extent of hormonal imbalance present as the condition is most often associated with other hormonal imbalances as well apart from those of the ovary. Metformin often helps in ovulation as insulin resistance which is a usual accompaniment, is cleared. Maintenance of a healthy weight, regular exercise and a healthy diet are also needed. To prevent the leakage of semen, use the prone position, i.e., lying on your stomach for at least half-an-hour after intercourse. Hope this helps."

Since your ECG and stress test is normal with controlled blood pressure, I don't think you are having any cardiac cause for your chest pain. In your case HERD seems more appropriate cause. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. The gas problem you have, is mostly a part of this only. So try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Avoid stress and anxiety. 4. Start proton pump inhibitor. 5. Go for walk after meals. 6. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in the bed."

"good morning sir, i have 6 months baby. he cannot drink milk and also weight less. i consult one doctor he given medicine CYP - L. I continue my douse to my baby but my baby continuously sleeping after giving that medicine. please give me some suggestions to over come this problem","I am glad that you have put up your query at Chat Doctor. Nutrition in an infant plays an important role in growth. 6 months of age is appropriate for weaning or introduction of semi-solids into the diet alongside mothers breast milk. In case you have not yet done it, I would insist addition of cereals to the diet. Certain babies have lactose intolerance and cannot digest milk and diarrhea, flatulence (passing gas), and abdominal pain occur. Abdominal bloating, abdominal distention, and nausea also may occur. The information that you have provided is inadequate to make the diagnosis certain. Lactose intolerance can be diagnosed by eliminating lactose from the diet, milk challenge, breath test, blood glucose test, stool acidity test, and intestinal biopsy. Avoidance of milk and milk-containing products can lead to a dietary deficiency of calcium and vitamin D that, in turn, can lead to bone disease (osteoporosis). Zero lac is a milk formulation containing no lactose and may be tried. If I had a patient like your baby, I would have not suggested Cyril which contains a Chat Doctor.  But it is not proven to be effective and has a sedative action. I would suggest you to consult some pediatrician before deciding on the intervention."

"My husband and I are renting an apartment in San Francisco for 2 weeks and I have a severe allergy to down.

Within one day I developed a running nose, draining down the throat, and now am coughing and have a headache.  There may be 2 down pillows in a closet in my  bedroom.

I already having a check up for a doctor and the doctor tell to that the result is normal. then i tell to him that i feel pain sometimes in my left kidney and he gave me a medicine uricol and riaspasm. It is okey to take those medicine even though the result is normal?","Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor. Flank pain require evaluation to confirm that pain is of kidney origin. It requires basic urine report, S. creatinine and sonography. Uricol & spasm are antispasmodic and urinary antiseptic. It helps if there is ureteric or GI colic, stone or infection. Before that you require confirmation of the cause of flank pain by above tests. Therapeutic Trial for 3-5 days can be safe. You communicate further with above reports. Best wishes. TC. Chat Doctor."

Bleeding pattern is a bit erratic after PLAN B, but it is quite an effective way of emergency contraception. Your symptoms are due to stomach upset, and not due to pregnancy, as it is too early to get them. I hope this answer helps you. Chat Doctor."

"I have a rash . It started just on my ankles and is severely itchy. After a while it left my legs and moved farther up my leg. It has continued to do this moving in a very systematic pattern along my body. It is mirrored on either side, like currently it is on both of my wrist , the insides of my upper arms, my inner thighs and just around the sides of my back. When it first started it was only one or two bumps, slightly red much like an irritated hair follicle , at a time and they only lasted in one spot for a couple of days before moving. Now they show up in much larger patches 10-15 at a time and last for a weeks or so before they move. This started back in Nov. I have seen my gp for the problem and he just keeps on prescribing me allergy medicine, so far we have done a topical cream and a rx antihistamine, it was immediately after starting the antihistamine that my rash mutated into larger sites with longer breeding time. I need to stop itching, any thoughts!! I have also spent many hours scouring the interenet for any picture that resembles what I have and I absolutely cannot find anything that matches it. The raised bump is the size of a very small pimple and nearly always the same color as my skin or slightly pink after lots of scratching .","Hello there, the description of the rash whicChatDoctores and goes since November may indicate an allergic component.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.

Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

I woke up this morning filling good about 2 hours into the day i was cleaning house when all of a sudden I got real dizzy light headed an then the hole room started spenning I went an layed down but it continued for about 2 hours finally started letting up i still get light headed when i stand up for a little bit now my kneck up to the bottom of my head acks and I have bad head acks,"Hi, I am Chat Doctor. I have read your message. I think I can help you. A per the query, you have reported a sudden onset of vertigo that was started when you were cleaning the house that reduced but persisted when you lie down and gets more as soon as you get up. Now, sudden onset of any neurological symptom suggests a possible stroke. And therefore I suggest that you go to an Emergency room as soon as possible and request an MRI of the brain to make sure that there is no stroke. If there is a stroke, you will need to be initiated for the appropriate medications depending on the type of stroke and also the duration after which you manage to reach the hospital. However, you have not reported any other feature like weakness or imbalance. So there is a possibility that instead of having a central cause of vertigo like stroke, you may actually have a peripheral vertigo like benign positional paroxysmal vertigo.  There are simple medicine like betahistine that will need to be initiated. There will also be exercises like Brandt Zaroff exercises that the doctors/neurologist will need to teach you. However, since stroke is a more serious condition, and a condition in whose management time is a very crucial factor, I think you should get to an emergency service in a hospital that boasts of a neurologist as soon as possible. Once the stroke is ruled out, then the peripheral causes can be considered and treated. I have tried to make it as simple as possible. I hope that you benefit from the suggestion. Please get to an emergency as soon as possible. In the meantime, try to remain still and in bed so that the episodes of vertigo do not worsen. Avoid sudden jerky head movements. Please note, I have assumed that you have no cardiac issues, no diabetes, no hypertension or any other significant past history, as this has not been mentioned in the query. Best of luck,"

In food poisoning, there is simultaneous appearance of fever and vomiting. After sometime, the child may develop loose stools. In acute gastroenteritis both loose tools and vomiting are present. Fever usually accompanies both of them. In my opinion, your child needs antibiotic like ofloxacin for a period of 3 days. Child should also be given antiemetic Chat Doctor.

"I got an injection of Methotrexate last Friday for ectopic pregnancy. Would there be any contraindication to starting my garcinia cambogia again? With all the address stress, cramps, and nausea I am eating like crazy and gaining weight. I was told not to work out for now until the Hgc levels have dissipated, but I have worked so hard to lose weight, the thought of gaining it back is making me even sicker..","Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Garcinia Cambodia is a supplement, so it is not tested for interactions with other Chat Doctor.  So there is no evidence that taking the supplement while on Methotrexate is harmful. I want to strongly caution you against exercise though, especially if it has been less than a week since you were diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies can still rupture after a methotrexate injection, so the straining of your abdomen during vigorous exercise could possibly traumatize your swollen tube.  You can bleed heavily internally and could need emergency surgery if your tube ruptures, and without prompt medical care some women even die from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. So your cravings from pregnancy should dissipate as you hormone levels fall, so hopefully you will feel less hungry over time.  In the meantime, you can take your supplement, but please be very careful and do not do any heavy exercise until your levels have fallen. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,"
"My mother, aged 69, shows signs of acute anaemia and we are trying to figure out the cause. She was hospitalised and treated a month ago for severe respiratory infection and given strong antibiotics. Side effects included tachycardia and significant drop in potassium levels, the latter of which was addressed with medication. She was discharged after 10 days, improved and regained her appetite. But for the last about 3-4 days she has been extremely tired and weak, has lost her appetite, finds it hard to swallow, is occasionally feverish, finds it a bit difficult to talk, and her feet and face are beginning to show signs of puffiness, all of which lead us to believe it might be anaemia. As she was thoroughly tested in hospital for kidney and lung problems, and given the all-clear, we believe this might be drug-related acute anaemia. Any advice/information would be much appreciated. Thanks.","Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She may have anemia. We should search for the cause of her anemia first. You should go for complete blood count, peripheral smear examination, anemia profile and ultrasound abdomen. This will give you exact cause of her anemia.

Your rising levels could be related to the booster shot. I know you are thinking perhaps they are rising in response to contact with her virus. Certainly this is a possibility, but again, its best that she get checked periodically anyway and consider treatment for her carrier state. Hope this helps."
"I just have a few questions about some fo my bloodwork and symptoms. I am a 24 y/o male. I currently am seeing a hem-onc regarding iron deficiency. My serum iron is 7 microg/dL, TIBC 460, transferrin sat 3%, and MCV 71.4. EGD and colonoscopy showed nothing, and Hemoccult negative for occult blood x2 separate occasions. I have been on p.o. iron for 5 months (serum feritin was 3 in nov 2010 and mar 2011 was 7). Also, celiac sprue panel negative. Hgb 13.8. All other blood tests and serum chemistry are normal. U/A was negative for blood. Retic count 2.5%. I have also had a couple of night sweats, spleen was 12 cm in 11/2010 and 14.5 cm in 2/2011, also I have 2 cervical lymph nodes (about 1cm each) enlarged just above clavicle. They are painless, but non-fixed and have been enlarged for about 8 weeks but have not increased in size. I have had no recent illnesses, except for strep throat in 12/2010 and glomerulonephritis shortly after that. I also have very bad exertional dyspnea since about october, to the point where Im SOB after 2-3 minutes of minimal exercise (and ive been taking tae kwon do for 2 yrs without any trouble unitl recently). I also am extremely tired recently (I used to operate on about 5 hrs sleep/night and am now sleeping 12-15 hrs/day). I have never had any anemia or iron deficiency before. I have no family hx of blood cancers; however, my maternal grandmother had stage 4 breast cancer at 31 y/o and stage 2 breast cancer (which was unrelated to the first cancer) at 40 y/o. No family hx of iron absorption dz. My hematologist recommended IV iron dextran 1x per month x 4 months. Just wanted to know if I need a second opinion or is this just probably an iron absorption problem. Only past med hx is mild GERD. Currently taking nexium (for past 5 years ) and Bifera rx iron supplement (since nov. 2010).","Hello, I would suggest an FNAC fine needle aspiration cytology of your neck lymph nodes if they are still enlarged. I presume that you have had a peripheral blood smear evaluated by a hematopathologist. If not then peripheral blood smear examination is necessary. If you have not done certain tests such as TSH thyroid stimulating hormone test you may also get that done. Based on your description your condition appears to be iron deficiency anemia. The exertional breathless sensation may be a symptom of anemia. However, as anemia is uncommon in a young male further work up is necessary especially that of your lymph node. A second opinion from a hematologist is prudent to exclude the possibility of a condition called lymphoma of your lymph node. Though it is a rare possibility it is prudent to get a second opinion. Best regards. Should you require further assistance in test interpretation please post your queries here?"
"I am 40 and my wife is 29. We tried IUI in 2002-2004 in Al Sabah but in vain. We tried IVF back in India but ended with lot of stress to my wife and caused obesity. In 2009, we started treatment by Homoeo Doctor from India and now my wife is fully fit with all positive results. This course ends in April. Can I go for IVF treatment in May without using any medicines if all results comply with fertilization? How much does it cost in Kuwait to go for IVF? BTW, my wife recently got all positive results but one of her fallopian tubes is completely blocked since birth. I guess, that is the only hindrance in conceiving.","Hi, It must have been quite a difficult phase going through so many treatments and not getting a result. Homeopathy has no such benefit on fertility. So it does not matter when you finish the course. The GUI are done only when there is An ovulation (difficulty in egg formation) or so the 3 years that you tried GUI were unnecessary, as I assume your wife must be in early 20 at that time and an ovulation is rare at such a young age unless she has PCs. Can you please tell why IVF was advised and did they know about the blocked tubes before GUI/IVF? If both tubes are blocked, IVF is the only option. If one of the tubes is blocked then natural conception is possible if all other reports including your sperm count are normal. Hope this helps. Regards."
"I went to the doctor last week because the inside of my mouth was swollen and my neck was too. she said it was from tmj and to go to the dentist. i went to the dentist and he gave me meds (steroids) to take, but the swelling has not gone down and my neck went from being swollen at top below ears to all around the front. any ideas? im going back to the dentist today.","Hi! Sorry to inform that you got some infection that now spreads in the floor of mouth, salivary glands and the regional lymph nodes as well! Because of huge inflammatory edema in the parotid / neck region now it would be difficult to examine the area clinically; therefore ultrasound or CT Scan is better for a diagnosis and broad spectrum antibiotics are very urgent to overcome the crisis otherwise the infection could spread more!

"I have a kidney stone that is 5mm since wednesday. I havent had a lot if pain today but i have blood in urine and a pressure feeling in abdomen still.

I am on toredol, oxycodine, flomax and ibprofine","Hi, Let me start my answer with a small description of the kidneys, ureter and urinary bladder. The collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyxes and pelvis. This collects the urine formed in the kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. I guess that you have got an ultrasound scan done, and it show shy Chat Doctor.  Since you have a 3 mm stone in the ureter, it is possible that the stone is now in the lower part of the ureter.

"Hello Dr.,   I am deeply concerned as I have just been diagnosed with emphysema in the lower parts of my lungs, even though I am only 43 and have never smoked, I have had numerous chest infections which I have been treated for - so really cant understand it - hows this come about and what can I do to slow it down, also will I die fairly soon as I have a young toddler and a baby to look after, please advise. Kind regards,Ann.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Recurrent chest infections can cause emphysema without smoking habit. Get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will tell you about severity of emphysema and treatment is based on severity only. You will need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).

Adult respiratory vaccines (pneumococcal and influenza) are advisable to prevent recurrent respiratory tract infection.Don't worry, with appropriate treatment you can't live normal life.

"Dear doc, My mother is 90 years old. recently she had fever and sore throat. her blood test result was OK regarding RBC and WBC. But her ESR is 64 and it was a source of concern for her GP. her general health is OK and she suffers from lifelong artherosis. Is there any probability of malignancy? thanks","Welcome to Chat Doctor I am Chat Doctor. Dear friend, as per history given by you is in favor of increased E.S.R due to Arthrosis (-a chronic inflammation) and recent infection (fever a dsore throat). As you told that her general health is ok then it is not looking due to any malignancy here. A chronic inflammation like Arthrosis is common cause of increased E.S.R.I advise you to repeat E.S.R, complete blood count and peripheral blood film after one week to rule out any other cause and to remove your doubt completely.

"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here... below my penile side my both sides of skin becomes dry and become very senstive i apply itch card the itching cream but it is not working its become very senstive and my skin colour change into red and black kindly tell me what is the problem","Hello. Thanks for writing to us at Chat Doctor Most likely it is a fungal infection; fungal infections are common at sites such as groin folds because the fungus gets a chance to proliferate in the moist, humid conditions that prevail in the folds, specially in hot and humid weather conditions like tropical countries. If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to use a topical cream containing antifungals like either Ketoconazole Or Fluconazole Or Bifonazole, twice daily for 4-6 weeks. I normally also ask my patients to take an oral antifungal because the condition may not respond adequately to just topical antifungal creams. Oral antifungals like Fluconazole, Itraconazole are faster acting and therefore rapidly effective in this condition. An OTC oral antihistamine e.g. cetirizine 10 mg once daily will provide you symptomatic relief from itching. I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis as well as appropriate prescription. Regards"

"Hi, have had a chest infection and pleurisy, am on antibiotics and infection seems to have cleared up although right side of chest still hurts when I cough. tonight my right side feels uncomfortable and seems a little puffy/swollen, could this be to do with the pleurisy?","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, possibility of pleurisy is more in your case. Most common cause for pleurisy is lung infection (pneumonia). Since you are already suffering from severe chest infection, pleurisy is likely in your case. Pleurisy will gradually resolve along with chest infection. You can take painkiller and anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  Get done repeat chest x-ray after 10 days to see whether pneumonia is improving or not. Hope I have solved your.

As per your history there can be Tuberculosis of spine leading to back pain and weight loss. Another possibility of disc compression. When such patient comes to my hospital we usually take x-ray spine or if required MRI to see for any nerve compression.

"Hi, my brother about three months ago, was taking magic mushrooms at least once a week. The last time he took the mushrooms he had a bad experience. Since then he has had a constant ongoing problem with what seems like severe anxiety . He complains of some pain in his face and body, and says that he feels like he is dieing. He goes to the hospital, where he has worked for several years, like it is a doctors office. He has been to the er about twenty times in the last two months and they have found nothing but an elevated ana reading in one of his latest visits. He has been generally healthy his whole life with no diagnosed mental deseas. However my mother and I suspect that he may be slightly bipolar, and other mental diseases like alzimers are present in my family. My brother is only 24 and just got married , probably not the best time, he and his new wife are also adopting his wife s sisters baby, as the sister is a drug addict. All of this is a huge stressor on him. I would love to know how to help him if you could point me in the right direction. As well as help his wife keep him from running to the hospital any time he starts to panic and starts to think that he is dieing. Thank you Josh","Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your query. Magic mushrooms (Psilocybin) can cause a variety of psychiatric problems like anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, etc. They can also exacerbate underling dormant psychiatric conditions. Your brother needs a detailed psychological assessment to arrive at a diagnosis and further treatment will be based accordingly. I would strongly advise you to take him or encourage him to go to a psychiatrist for further evaluation and treatment.  Wish you all the best. -"

Dizzy and just not myself,"Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Low WBC count may be due to some viral infection. Low level of ANA should not be worry.

"my English is not very good i wonder if you will understand me, but i will try my best. i always have pain in my upper abdomen every time i eat fatty food or drink beverages, and the food that i ate will not digest. ive gone to endoscopy and the result was i have hernia. the doctor gave me Omeprazole 20mlg. but still the pain is still there. i  also had an ultra sound and the result was i have a fatty liver. i am 52 years old asian woman with 175 pounds, 53 in height. thank you...","Hi, How are you? Fatty liver can be caused by excessive alcohol intake (Alcoholic SEATO hepatitis, ASH) or due to excessive fatty food intake and sedentary lifestyle (Non-alcoholic SEATO hepatitis, NASH). ASH is usually the beginning stages of alcohol induced liver damage and is completely reversible if the patient refrains from alcohol. NASH is being much more commonly diagnosed currently owing to poor dietary habits and sedentary lifestyles of people. High caloric intake, high fatty food intake and poor exercise regimens lead to deposition of fat goblets in the liver tissue leading to fatty liver (which shows up as increased echo texture on USG). This is also completely reversible in the initial stages if caloric intake is limited and exercise regimens are adhered to. If left unchecked, patients usually become obese, diabetic and in final stages may lead to cirrhosis of the liver which will necessitate a liver transplant. I would suggest a healthy diet and exercise regimen. Although there is no time limit on when to get a repeat scan, I would suggest one, once you have succeeded in losing some weight. Regarding your hernia, I presume it is hiatal hernia (as it was diagnosed during endoscopy). This usually does not need any treatment other than over the counter ant-acids (omeprazole, pantoprazole etc.), but if you are having a lot of heart burn or reflux, then a simple surgery (fundoplication) will be curative. Hope this helped, and please do not hesitate to contact me for further details - rxsuresh@gmail.com"
"Hi have really bad cough wont go away get bronchis lots , lots of phelm ) do you know of any over counter medicines to break up fast going out of Canada soon on vacation.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Continuous cough with phlegm is more suggestive of bronchitis (inflammation of airways).So the best treatment would be inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Oral N acetyl cysteine (NAC) is also a good bucolic Chat Doctor. I am not sure whether these are available over the counter (OTC) in Canada.

"Today my son was operated on to remove glass from his hand. The nurse who discharged him, said if he had pain he could take Ibuproven with the prescription Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen. Is this ok, I want to make sure she knows what she is talking about.","Hi, As your son was operated it can cause postoperative pain and inflammation, and it needs to be controlled with anti-inflammatory painkillers. However, the use of painkillers is dependent on the severity of pain, so you should give him painkillers depending on the need of painkillers. If your son is in pain you can give him Ibuprofen as it will help in reducing inflammation as well as pain.  In case if the pain does not get better with it than it is advisable to consult his doctor once and proceed with HY Chat Doctor.  Hope I have answered your query.

I got my wishom tooth pulled on the left side bottom number 17 i think on june 6 friday i was put to sleep while doing it. now its friday and its not 100 percent better mouth still feels sore and jaw is swollen i cant hardly open my mouth or brush my teeth or either my tongue right im feeling miserable and its getting on my nerves. I DO THE SALT AND WARM water thing and i take the antibiotic but its like im missing the time to take it but im taking it. Please help me when will this pain be over im getting aggravated please help me.,"Hello, You can try some anti-inflammatory medications in addition to your antibiotic. Cold works well initially to reduce inflammation such as swelling, but then you want good blood flow to promote healing. Try some moist heat to relax the muscles and improve blood flow to assist healing. Try to maintain a soft diet. Realize this is bone surgery and will take a long time to heal. Soreness is to be expected, but will gradually lessen. Continue to do your best to continue good dental care and rinsing.  Your first week will be the most difficult. Your second week should show improvement, but some if you had significant surgery and swelling, this inflammation needs time to resolve. Your TMJ could have been stressed. Your age and overall health can be a factor in how well you respond and the speed of healing. Your antibiotic needs to be at a certain level for a certain period of time to be effective. Follow your prescription as directed. If you miss a dose, do not double up, but try to get back on schedule as soon as possible. If you feel your antibiotic is not working and your discomfort is getting worse, contact your dentist. You may require a different antibiotic. Your dentist can prescribe additional stronger medications to assist healing, reduce inflammation and pain if necessary. You should have a followup visit. Do you have sutures that need to be removed? You may feel tightening as healing progresses. Should you continue to have difficulties with your jaw function, there could be a complication with your TMJ, fracture or delayed healing which would require further evaluation? I hope you can be patient, and you mouth feels better with time. Thank you for your inquiry. I would be glad to answer any additional questions concerning your progress."

If the stomach pain is central and not associated with any other symptoms such as fever, jaundice, vomiting, bowel or bladder dysfunction, then it is not likely to be benign. Toddlers are prone to abdominal pains especially due to gut infestation by parasites. I usually recommend to deform the child with Single dose of Albendazole and repeat dose after 15 days. Along with this give healthy diet with lots of fluids especially water. Avoid spicy and oily food for the time being including fast foods. Hopefully this will help. In case the pain is associated with any of the above-mentioned symptoms, then a proper clinical examination by pediatrician will help. For any further questions, you may contact me. Take care"

The next day he started with flu-like symptoms, fever. A few days later his ankle inflamed, and he notice an ulcer on his foot which was infected. He went to doctor and got antibiotics. The fever went away but the ulcer is curing slowly. I personally think that is he has Diabetes which started to manifest because of the infection, but Im only a third year student with a long way to go so now....What do you think?","Hi, Going by the history and presentation alone, it could be a case of osteomyelitis in my opinion, however there are other conditions and risk factors too. Like his immunization status for tetanus is important but Titans is uncommon nowadays. So rusty nail puncture wounds can cause pseudocodes osteomyelitis. Diabetes, Low blood supply, neuropathy etc. are the risk factors. Diabetic ulcer do not present with fever, so it points towards diagnosis of osteomyelitis, he should be treated with antibiotics and pus should be sent for culture & sensitivity, and treated accordingly.

"I have high blood pressure, a hiatus hernia and barrets ostophgaus of which i am given medication of omeprazole 20mg, amias 16mg and bendroflumethiazide 2.5mg. recently they changed my tablets from pariet to omeprazole to save costs. I have been feeling very ill with symptoms of dizziness, disorientation, blurred vision and a severe dry mouth. Also I have blocked sinus s. I am always very tired and the docs have come back with nothing from my blood tests. What can this be???","Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms could be related to a sinus infection. It is less likely that your symptoms are related to switching to omeprazole, as it is a similar Chat Doctor.  Coming to this point, I would recommend performing sinus X-ray study coupled with a sinus discharge study. If these tests result normal, I would recommend trying to switch again to pantoprazole for some days. If this helps improve your situation, it would indicate possible low tolerance to omeprazole. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Wishing good health,"

One monnh back I visited doctor andsuggested to blood work.then hegave the medicine for isnophilia for one month.now i stopped after using one month.now still iam having sneezes,cough particularly in night time.would you give any advisee","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Eosinophils are marker of allergic inflammation. And your symptoms like sneezing, coughing at night are suggestive of allergic rhinitis and bronchitis. So you need to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). You have to take treatment fir at least 6-8 months.

My doctor has asked me to cahnga to Formonide 400 twice a day , in lieu of Budecort. Please advise. I am miserable. I live in Pune, Maharashtra, India.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should get done chest x-ray first to rule out chest infection. As infections are the most common cause for COPD worsening. And you are having phlegm also, which favors infection. So better to start antibiotics also to suppress infection. And phoronid 400 is having steroid in higher dose. So no harm in taking it. Also start bucolic SND cough expectorant.

"Im a 25 year old female and weight about 127 lbs. Im a regular blood donor but yesterday I was told I couldnt donate because my hemoglobin levels were too low. I was told I need to eat more iron, however Im very healthy and given my current diet, it seems odd that I would be lacking iron. Is there anything else that could be causing this? Ive also had liver problems in the past and was wondering if poor liver function would effect hemoglobin levels.","Hi, dear. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  Your hemoglobin level is low.  You have iron deficiency anemia.  Most common cause of low iron in adult female is excessive blood loss.  Mostly heavy menstruation or some urine bleeding.  You should consult your gynecologist and go for examination.  Then take treatment accordingly. Take iron rich food like beggary, dates, green leafy vegetables, Chat Doctor.  You can also take oral iron supplements.  Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer.

Hello i have been taking 5mg of folic acid for about 2 months now. I just learned I am pregnantz. Then I read somewhere that the normal Supplement should only be 400-800 mcg. I did Not know this. Is there a risk to me and my baby as it seems to be quite an excessive dose. Tnx,"Hello dear, I UND your concern. In my opinion even if the higher doses of folic acid are taken it will not result in toxicity as maximum part of it is excreted in urine. So nothing to worry. Many of the folic acid preparation supplements are of 5 mg. Though the requirement is 500mcg we usually prescribe 5 mg for the initial 3 months of pregnancy and in a few indicated patients it is started 1 month before conception and continued for 3 months of pregnancy. So relax. Avoid stress. It doesn't harm the baby. Best regards..."
My 86 year old Mom had a severe angina attack last Saturday...this was the worst one yet.  Her ICU Doctor told me that he doesnt really think that she has much more than 3 months to live...how to you think he arrived at this conclusion?  Aggressive therapy has been ruled out as a very high risk for her.,"Hello, Brief Answer: Factors such as comorbidities, age, heart functions, and other investigations may aid to give a life span for such conditions. Explanation: My opinion is that ischemic heart disease is a bit of concern these days. Treatments range from medical to invasive coronary intervention. In some cases, a coronary angiogram may show heavy lesions that make it impossible to intervene either percutaneous or even surgery. Also, the clinical condition of the patient is taken into consideration during the assessment. Life span is a range of time that may be inaccurate in some cases. Factors such as comorbidities, age, heart ejection fraction and treatment options may aid to get that type of range. I suggest my patients the following lifestyle change and adherence to anti-ischemic. The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition, I would ask them about medical history, other comorbidities, and echocardiography data. Conclusion: I suggest you check with your physician. Focus on your mom treatment options. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

SIR LAST NIGHT I GOT NIGHTFALL AND ALSO A PRESSUR OF URINE WHEN I WENT TO RELEASE URINE  NO PAIN WERE THER BUT AL THE LAST MOMENT IT PAINS BADLY  HOWEVER I TRIED TO RELEASE URIN COMPLETLY  .   TELL ME ITS NOT REGULAR BUT MAY BE IT FALL ONCE IN 2 WEEKS,"Dear user, Thank you for contacting Chat Doctor. I understand your concerns regarding night emission. Semen is being manufactured by genital organs continuously; it has to be expelled by some means. This situation is just akin to a glass of full water to which you add more water, with the logical result that it overflows! This happens to semen too. If one neither has sex nor masturbation for long time, semen gets expelled in the form of night emissions, which is normal.  This is not an illness or disease. If you engage in regular sexual activity like masturbation or sex with your partner, night emission will not occur. Difficulty in passing urine followed by pain might be due to some other problem related to urine pathway (Not due to night emission). If you have recurrent painful voiding, go for consultation with surgeon or urologist. Wish you good health."

I have been taking famera for infertility. I had gotten my period and it was the regular length in time of 6 days. I am now on day 9 and have started bleeding again. I have also had tingling in my tongue the past couple of days. I am 27 years old and was wondering if I could have been pregnant when starting this cycle of famera without knowing it.,"Hello, Thanks for the query. It's not quite possible to fix the reason for your intermittent bleeding without doing urine pregnancy test. It may be unlikely if you had good flow for 6 days. But I recommend you to do the home urine pregnancy test with morning urine sample to rule out pregnancy for sure.  If it's not pregnancy you can just choose to wait for a few days to see if your bleeding stops. Random menstrual disturbances are not uncommon to find and just letting it settle on its own will do the trick most of the time. If you still continue to bleed or if your UPT comes positive do visit your doctor who may do an ultrasound scan to find the cause for bleeding and evaluate further if needed. Hope this helps. Good luck."

You must keep this in mind while working also and if you develop pain then you should refrain from that activity.

It could be a cervical/ uterine polyp which is constantly causing discharge and bleeding. You need to rule out these before you plan for pregnancy. A detailed clinical examination by a Gynecologist to rule out any problem on the cervix. Also, an ultrasound to see for any problems with the lining of the womb. Taking closed without ultrasound monitoring of follicles will not be very beneficial. Do rule out other problems before taking closed. Hope this helps. Regards."

Definitely, you are on high dose Oxycontin and lyrics. I always start Oxycontin with lower dosage such as 10 mg 3-4 times and lyrics 75 mg one or two tabs a day. The dizziness and falling asleep is due to side effects. I would suggest reducing the dose gradually and if there is breakthrough pain then consider one tab stat. 80 mg is the max limit for Oxycontin and don't exceed above that. In coming days, pain will reduce and continue complete rest for 1-2 weeks. Thanks."

"i am from sri lanka.my aunt is suffering from breast cancer.she underwent a surgery and she recovered but after some time when doctors checked her blood report her blood count was high and doctors suspected that cancer might have spread to the womb and she underwent a womb operation,but her blood count started increasing day by day.she cant eat food, even though she eats some kind of food,result is vomiting and she is having a allergy rash all over her body.she is admitted to the hospital today.but doctors are refusing to say what is the exact reason.it would be a great help if any doctor over here can explain me.please","Hi.your aunt probably has metastasis from her breast cancer already. If your aunt is on chemotherapeutic agents, the symptoms she's experiencing right now might be secondary to those medications which are expected. During chemotherapy, her immune system is expected to weaken. During this stage, precautions must be observed as she is more prone to infection and illness. But after the chemo-treatment, her immune system will eventually bounce back. Please advise her to continue eating on time even if it seems she has no appetite as proper nutrition would be of great help during her treatment process. A referral to a clinical nutritionist would also be of great help. Keep strong and praying. Hope this helps.- Chat Doctor."
My 2 year daughter reveived nebvent treatment and was prescribed predcort ds 10mg/5mls to be taken 1 and1/2 teaspoon full daily . hawever when we got home she started itching all over her body and and red blotches developed on her skin. I think she is having a reaction to the medication . What should i do and what should i give her to stop the itching.,"Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor, There is a good possibility it's a reaction to the Chat Doctor.  First thing to be done is to immediately stop all medicines. Give plenty of liquids for child to take orally. As far as itching is concerned, you can apply lactocalamine lotion over the red itchy areas that would comfort. Before starting any medicines to reduce itching, I would advise you to consult a doctor so that those lesions can be seen. Hope your child recovers soon. Take care."
"I have had a rash that started 3 mos., ago, that were small blisters on my back, chest and stomach.  Went to urgent care and was given steroids.

Got a little better by taking a vaginal yeast infection pill once a week for 4 weeks.  Started to go away and wont seem to go away, Help!!!!!","Hello, Thanks for the query, If there was a response to antifungal, probably you have a yeast infection.

"Hi, I was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy 3 years ago. At my last appointment with my cardiologist he said he was surprised how much I had improved. This improvement showed on an echocardiogram. However recently I have had palpitations with a cough more frequently,but it is usually if I drink alcohol or strong coffee. If I abstain from drinking am I likely to improve again. I exercise regularly and am a healthy weight?","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, your symptoms are mostly due to alcohol ingestion. Since you are improving with heart condition, no need to worry about cardiac cause for these symptoms. Alcohol ingestion causes HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Alcohol causes laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. And because of this patient can have palpitations and coughing. So better to avoid alcohol. Start proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic Chat Doctor.  Avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

Regarding your concern, the proton injection is generally given to support the pregnancy. It doesn't have any major side effects apart from bloating.

I am in Haiti. I have a friend whose 3 year old son drank kersosene this week. He has a cough and fever. They do not know how much he drank or exactly wwen. They did not take him for medical care. A doctor told them to give milk. Should they seek any medical care at this time? Should an x-ray be done of his chest? He did vomit near the time of ingestion,"Following an ingestion of the substance, immediately water can be given to Chat Doctor. In case of symptoms that indicate difficulty in swallowing including vomiting or decreased alertness, do not give anything by way of mouth. Do not try to induce vomiting. Kerosene is a corrosive poison and can lead to aspiration. Chest X-ray may be needed to rule out any aspiration and pneumonitis in lungs. I suggest that he should definitely be examined by a physician. Hope that was helpful. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards"
"I have Stage IIIc Endometrial cancer Only 1 of 19 lymph nodes was positive I am scheduled for Chemo therapy AND radiation, and Megace was added to my drug regimen. Is there anything else I might need in the near future? What is my 5 yr survival rate?",Hiyou will need radiotherapy in the form of pelvic EBERT and vaginal brachytherapy along with chemotherapy. Node positivity indicates bad prognosis but because you have only one node positivity (and I suppose para aortic nodes are negative) you have better prognosis among stage III. Prognosis and recurrence depends on grade and type of tumor also. Endometriosis variety has better prognosis than adenocarcinoma than clear cell than undifferentiated types. Grade 3 obviously has poor prognosis. If endometriosis grade1 stage then 5yr survival rate is around 70%. But other variants grade3 still 5yr sure rate around 50% only.

I was damaged by an fq drug, have since recovered (more or less), and since then i have taken keflex without incident , but i know there are some drugs that can cause similar effects, and might further damage me.",Hi. Thanks for the query. If you are allergic to Fluroquinolones and have safely taken Reflex that contains active ingredient Cephalexin that is indicative that you are well adapted to Cephalosporins group of antibiotics.

It looks like you have lost a substantial amount of weight. However, please check your target weight and try to get to that gradually. The weight loss should be done in a healthy way as it is to be done for life. Your medications are surely helping you get to the desired control, but your fasting glucose could be a little higher. The normal cut-off is from 70-130. So there are two options here. You could take a light late night snack or come down on the dose of glyceride. Please try coming down slightly on the dose of glyceride at night and recheck your blood glucose levels. Please do a post radial level also when you check. Kindly revert if needed. Hope this helps.

I have an uncle in hospital he is in a comma he has been for about a month. His brain is like a balloon. He has so much problems going on do you think he will be safe to transfer him to another hospital ? He ended in the hospital due to pheamoina and seziure he was good in the cast cane but he ended up being stabilized. Its so much to it. Do u think he will make it or even have a change ??,"Hi, Thanks for writing in. If your uncle is being taken care of by the nurses and doctors then better to allow him to stay at once place. However, if the facility is causing him to worsen then better to shift him out, but before shifting have a consultation with doctors and be sure the other hospital has better facilities and is well-equipped in case of an emergency. Brain swelling or edema is a condition when there is water accumulation in the brain. This can happen when there is an infection or inflammation in the brain. Anti edema measures are started but in some patients brain swelling takes time to respond to medications. It is important to know how much is the coma score of your uncle. The coma score is based on an international scale and graded from 3/15 for a patient who is dead to 15/15 for a normal person. If the coma score is more than 7/15 then it is likely that your uncle might make a recovery. Please discuss this score with nurses and doctors. Wish him a quick recovery."
"Hi, I am a 59-year-old male with Guillain-Barre Syndrome who is suffering from extreme, constant pain.  I am currently taking Percocet 10-325 four times a day, however this is not helping.  The main problem I am encountering is the both the strength of the medication and duration that the medication lasts for.  I have spoken to my doctor about this problem, and he gave me a choice of several other pain relief medications that I can try.  They are Oxycodone, Oxycontin supplemented with Percocet, and MS Contin.  I am wondering which of these medications would have the longest duration of pain relief, while at the same time delivering a stronger effect than the Percocet I am currently taking.  As an aside, I have had both Percocet 10-325 and Oxycodone 10 available to me at the same time due to a prescription mix up.  When these two medications were taken together, they alleviated my pain completely for more than the 6 hour time period that the dose was supposed to perform for, and allowed me to take regular Percocet 10-325 for the rest of the day without any significant increase in pain.  However, this solution in and of itself has not been something that has worked as well as I hoping it would work.My question is, of the options I have been offered, keeping in mind they are the only ones available to me at this given time, I need to know not only which would be the most efficient and longest lasting, but also, mot probably the safest.I would also like to add that during two recent visits to the hospital, each of which lasted one week, I was given 4 mg of morphine every 6 hours with no ill effects whatsoever.Thank you for any advice you can offer.","Hi, Thank you for posting your query. It is unfortunate that you are suffering from severe pain, following Guillain Barre syn Chat Doctor. I see many patients with GBS and about half of them have severe neuropathic pain.

"hi po. i am having a lump on my right armpit. i used to have some before but this time, it is comparably bigger than what i used to have. it started about 3-4 days ago during my first day of my monthly period what might this be and what could be an immediate remedy? thank you very much!","HIT hanks for posting your query.  It could be either a Lymph node or Lipoma or sebaceous cyst. 1. Lymph Node : These are normally present in the armpit, and they enlarge in size if there is any infection, trauma or inflammation in the hand, arm or chest. 2. Lipoma : Is a localized collection of fat. 3. Sebaceous cyst : are closed sac like structure that occurs due to blockage of oil secreting glands under the skin.  The evaluation and the treatment depend on what is the swelling. You need to get a test called FNAC (Fine needle aspiration cytology) which will tell what is the swelling.  Kindly get it done and revert. Hope this information was useful to you."

Hi my mum had a stroke a bit over a year ago. all has been fine except for now her blood pressure is high and the Karvea 300mg tablets do not seem to be working anymore her GP doesn t seem to want to put her on anything else so we suggested could she swap to 150mg of Karvea twice a day to see if it worked in keeping her blood pressure down during the evening because that is when it rises to around 190/100. He has agreed to split the dose from 300mg once a day to 150mg twice a day but I am now wondering if we did the right thing or will that raise her blood pressure even more . Do the 300mg tablet and the 150mg tablet release the same amount throughout the day Please help can you give me your advice on this as I need a second opinion,"Hi welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your query and concern.300 mg and 150 mg release different amount of Chat Doctor. Hence, it has to taken as 300 mg of Area to have adequate good control to prevent future stroke.

"Hi - If I stop taking the Pill , will that stop Cervical Erosion? If so, how long do I need to wait to see improvements. I have experienced slight bleeding after sexual intercourse with my partner over the last few months, and have been told by a GP that being on the Pill increases your chances of cervical erosion. I have been on the Pill for 4 years now. Please help.","Hello Ella.scratch, Taking the Oral Contraceptive Pill increases the chances of cervical erosion, simply because the inner lining of the cervix events out under the effect of estrogen in the Pill. Stopping the Pill may stop this erosion. Since this lining is thinner than the lining of the vagina there may be some spotting after sex.Most of the time, however, there may be no symptoms. Having said this, may I add these comments:1) If there is any discharge - yellow or curry white or itchy or foul/fleshy smell, you will need local and oral anti-infection medicines. Please check out with your doctor for this. The vaginal inserts may be available over the counter from the local pharmacy.2) Since you have bleeding after intercourse, please do get your latest Pap Smear done even if you have had one done within last 1 year. This is to screen for cervical cancers. If you could get HPV testing also, it will relieve you greatly if the reports are negative.3) Even if you are on the Pill for prevention of unwanted pregnancy, it may be wise to use a condom in addition for prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Please don't be so alarmed - cervical erosion reverse, they can be treated with anti-infectives and ablative treatments like cryotherapy, they don't always indicate cancer and are often more often benign/noncancer. Hope this answers your query. Take care, Chat Doctor."

If I was your treating doctor I would like to ask you that whether you were doing something stressful that time or you were worried about something if not then there is nothing to trigger a panic attack. Now regarding your murmur I would like to suggest you to consult a physician in person, and also I would like to do an ECG and ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY to rule out any structural or fictional defect that can cause a murmur.

"Dr. Sir, my brother, 64 years old, is suffering from endocrine carcinoid and is at the 4th stage. Since August 2010, he is receicving 30 mg LAR injection from Forties.  His weight is losing day by day.  He is very weak.  He is insisting to get him checked from AIIMS.  Please advise.  Regards.",Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Stage for carcinoid tumor is having very poor prognosis.  Life expectancy is less than 7-8 months. The hormones produced by tumor causes high metabolic rate and excessive every loss. So weight loss is more pronounced. Rapidly dividing cancer cells also release chemokines which causes decreased appetite and low oral intake. So weight loss is inevitable. In my opinion she is having terminal stage illness and life expectancy is less than 4 months.
"Hi my sister had Hep C and was treated with Harvoni about 1 yr ago. Now the Hep C is gone, but she continues to internal bleeding. Three or four bouts of this since August. Doctors can not find where the blood is coming. They have cauterized a couple of small Variocese but this keeps happening. The most recent on Friday, they could not find any reason for the blood. Did Endoscopy and CT scan and no leaks. But she throws up pure blood. What could be causing this???","Hello. Thanks for asking on Chat Doctor. Hepatitis c treatment would not cause bleeding. However, an underlying liver ailment might. Liver produces coagulation factors and impaired liver function can lead to bleeds.

He might just do an endoscopy to see what's wrong and treat it. Thanks."

Repeated usage of emergency contraceptive pills can lead to problems like hormonal imbalance, menstrual irregularity etc. For more details : http://srsree.blogspot.in/2012/08/emergency-contraceptive-pill-short-term.html The usual recommend gap between two emergency pills is two months. As you are not having menstrual irregularity, there may not be any problem for fertility. As you have used the pills for longer period, better to avoid emergency pills from downwards. You once go for ultrasound to check the uterine size, endometrial thickness, ovaries etc. Then track the ovulation in next cycle and plan intercourse around that period. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy. Take care."

"29 year old female. Made Dr. appt. for RLQ abdominal pain. Physical examination , including palpitation of the RLQ produced increasing pain. Dr. Ordered labs drawn - WBC was elevated, potassium was slightly low. Ultrasound was ordered for the following day, as well as 500mg amoxacillin tid. Ultrasound of lower and upper abdomen showed irregular heterogenous area in upper aspect of the right lobe of the liver of mixed echogenicity. Suggested atypical pattern of fatty infiltration, or atypical hemangioma . Recommended CT scan of abdomen and pelvis to evaluate the liver. CT scan showed fatty liver with area of enhancement in the lateral aspect of the right lobe of the liver (2.9 cm), normal pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands , and appendix. CT summary: may reflect an atypical hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia (I am on birth control pills), or hepatic adenoma. Suggests a nuclear medicine sulfur colloid study. Since these test, I have continued to have lower right abdominal pain as well as new onset lower left abdominal pain, less frequent. I also have had what I used to think was heartburn or acid reflux pain in right upper abdomen directly under the ribs and near the center of the upper abdomen. I now suspect this pain is related to the findings on the liver. I also have sharp pains randomly that seem to shoot from the front of my chest to my middle to upper back on the right. I have bright yellow urine and I do not take any vitamins. My medications are metoprolol, maxide, triphasil, and cymbalta. I am also currently taking the amoxacillin and potassium. I have fluid retention in my ankles and sometimes in my hands so badly I cannot remove my ring. My belly swells directly under my ribcage making me feel pregnant, which I am not. Any information would be helpful as my next appt (nuc med) is not for another week and I m driving myself crazy looking for answers! Thanks!","Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is possible that your symptoms (abdominal pain and bloating) may be related to focal nodular hyperplasia. However, we do need to rule out problems like gastroesophageal reflux disease. In this regard, small meals at regular intervals; an early dinner and Tablet Prevail OTC 20 will help. It is unlikely that the amoxicillin and potassium will actually help relieve your symptomsHowever, the fluid retention in the ankles and the hands needs to be looked into.

I m 18 weeks pregnant. My scan reports are normal but i have lower abdomen pain sometimes. My doc advised me to take susten 100 mg twice daily for 10 days. Is it safe for me and my baby to take this medicine. I am worried because i m reading the side effects of this medicine on the internet.Please advice.,"Hello, As your scan is normal, there is no need for worry. You should continue using Austen as prescribed by your doctor. Susten reduces chances of miscarriage and helps in maintain pregnancy, which might be the reason your doctor prescribed it. Due to the growing fetus it is normal to have some lower abdominal pain and discomfort. Discomfort will keep on increasing as pregnancy progresses.

These medications should be used on a full stomach. You should also reduce any movements or lifting activities that aggravate the area to allow it to heal. I hope this helps"

I am very concerned because having had medication changed, the stools are still yellow.","Hi & Welcome to Chat Doctor. Incomplete data like age, gender, purpose for taking Lifecycle for years.

For complete recovery to occur following the discontinuation of Lifecycle it may need 4-6 weeks for the liver functions to restore to normal, hence the color of the stool may remain yellow for quite some time.

"I am living on pain meds and I hate them, I want epidural injections and am waiting for my MRI tomorrow, also I have emphysema I take Theophelline 3x 200 ml do U know of a better pain med than percocet, I refuse to take morphine or oxy, also there is a new pill for breathing do U know of it ? Anything will help me// TMJ due to broken jaw this I realize I will have to treat with soma forever, panic well controlled with xanax TID 1.o mg","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done1. Chest x ray2. PUT (pulmonary function test) to know the severity of emphysema. As treatment of emphysema is based on severity, PFT is must. And first line therapy for emphysema is inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid. Inhaled bronchodilators in the form of Long acting beta 2 agonists (LAB) and anticholinergic. They will improve lung function and thus give you more symptomatic relief. They also act directly on lungs, so systemic side effects are avoided. And they are far better than theophylline, so it should be replaced by inhaled treatment in you. Better to consult pulmonologist and start more effective and appropriate treatment."
What is the best birth control pill to take? I am will be starting birth control soon and am wondering from personal experience what is the best birth control pill to take? I have heard there are issues with women gaining weight or breaking out while on birth control and I dont want these issues. Are there any birth control pills that you can recommend that wouldnt cause one to break out or gain weight? Or any that are non to help a person lose weight? Thanks in advance.,"Hallow Dear, There are varied types of birth control pills. Some contain low progesterone and high estrogen, some are balanced while others are low estrogen and progesterone dominant pills. I do not want to bother you with the continuous and sequential and such types of pills. Generally, the women who are having estrogen dominance should take progesterone dominant pills, those with Progesterone dominance should prefer Estrogen dominant pills while the balanced women may take any type of pills. Estrogen dominant girls are usually short stature, having gorgeous breasts and their menses are heavier; while Progesterone dominant girls are taller with smaller breasts and have lighter menstrual cycles. You can decide about your hormonal balance and accordingly choose the pills. Any pills you take, they do increase weight due to water retention. Also, there is some fat deposition as these hormones are cholesterol based. With restriction on salt and dietary fat intake, you can control the weight gain. Break through bleeding usually is more common in Progesterone dominant pills; however, any pills may cause it. It is not an issue and can be controlled just by taking an additional pill. I feel you should have little more positive view towards birth control pills. The pills do get adjusted to the body eventually. I hope this helps you."

Thank you for your query. I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. These symptoms and signs are suggestive of STD especially if there is associated pain, fever, urethral discharge and recent sexual intercourse.

I have breast cancer in my lungs and one lung is partially collapsed. I have a bad cough so my onc put me on anitbiotics. Im about half done (5 of 10 days) but the mucus is unbelievable! I have always swallowed it but now my stomach is upset. Is the only thing to stop the mucus production time? Is there anything else I can do while waiting?,"Hello friend, I hope you have breast cancer and along with that or secondarily developed lung cancer also. From the history it appears that the collapse of the lung and the diminished activities in the organ produces extra amount of mucus which is constantly brought out by cough. Antibiotics will not be useful because it is not the bacteria that make the problem, it is the general deterioration you have that make you prone to infection if at all it is there. So what is required is to improve your vitality.

Antibiotics may kill the bacteria for some time and is sure to recur because in addition to the lowered vitality, the strong chemo Chat Doctor.

Hello Dr. Prasad. I am 41 year old . I have recently developed scalp psoriasis around my ears which looks very odd.I had been to a skin specialist who asked me to get my Fe levels checked and sd i must go for some nutritional medicines from Amway which also included fish oil omega 3 which can speed up the treatment. SInce i am a vegetarian i dont want to take fish oil.Is there any other way i can get this treated?,"Hello. Thanks for writing to us at Chat Doctor Psoriasis patients do not have low Iron levels neither do Fish Oils neither Omega-3 Fatty acids have any definite role in treating psoriasis. I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist who would start you on specific therapy for psoriasis usually ask my patients of scalp psoriasis to use a coal tar+salicylic acid based shampoo, daily Or every alternate days. Psoriasis is a steroid responsive dermatitis; topical treatment is mainly based on steroid+salicylic acid lotions, twice daily. Topical steroids bring about a remarkable improvement in the condition as soon as 2 -3 weeks. Topical Vitamin D analogues e.g. calcitriol, calcopotriene are alternative topical remedies for psoriasis. They are available in a lotion form combined with or without topical steroids. Once significant improvement has been achieved with topical treatment, the improvement can be maintained with shampoos. Regards"
hi a few week ago i went to my gp with pains in my chest and trouble breathing which they treated as a chest infection and give me antibiotics then a week later as i finished my course of tablets i started to get pain in my lower stomach which i went back to my gp and she said i had a water infection so put me on another course of antibiotics then on friday this week as i fisheeed that course i got an infection in my leg which i went to the out of hours surgery and they have put me on two lots of antibiotics again. so i was wondering do you think all this has any thing in commen and do i need to go and see my gp again as i am not feeling to good in my self at the moment and keep getting pains back in my stomach? thanks mark,"Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should definitely rule out bronchitis in your case. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."
"HI, I have been on 30 mg morphine for upper back for 8 months. 3 weeks ago I came down with what I thought was a cold and then a week later I went to urgent care where they told me I had bronchitis. I have had bronchitis in the past and have never experienced such bad chest pain. I am feeling better now and have noticed that I still am experiencing chest pain but it is only after I take a morphine pill. I don t know why this is happening. Can it be from the morphine or is it something else?","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, morphine can cause gastritis and related chest pain. But better to rule out heart related chest pain because you are taking morphine since 8 months and morphine can cause cardiac complications. So get done ECG and 2d echo first. If both these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Take pantoprazole tablet on empty stomach before taking morphine. This will reduce gastritis related chest pain. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."

"my 22 month old has red, blotchy spots on the palms of her hands with some small red bumps in some areas. It is very itchy for her and I dont know what is causing it. I havent changed any kind of body soap, lotion, hand soap or detergents. I have tried over the counter anti itch creams and lotions and have given her allergy medicine to try and help her but nothing is working.","Hello Kim, Thanks for posting on Chat Doctor, Your daughter might have contracted a fungi rash which will require antifungi medication to treat it. Giving antihistamines alone without treating the actual cause would not work. If antihistamine has been administered properly and rash still persist, then allergy might be excluded. Other medications such as oral steroid can also get rid of allergic reactions when antihistamines alone fail.Also, possible are bacterial or viral infection of the palm skin most probably dermatitis. Local creams (antibiotics, antifungal or steroid etc.) could be administered to help deal with the affection. If rash persist, please do not hesitate to consult a dermatologist."
"I have been having some sort of neurological brain issue for about a year. I hear a noise in my right ear only (sounds like electrical noise that starts with a few pulses then increases in duration over a period of about 10-15 seconds when it abruptly ceases) that occurs evry couple of minutes. During the last 5 seconds or so of each episode the noise affects my eyes whereas they seem to jitter ever so slightly. This is very distarcting while I am working at my computer terminal. My neurologist has done a MRI and an ECG but neither has shown any abnormalities. He suspects some sort of seizure is causing this. He has started me on Lamictal. Do you agree with this diagnosis, and if a seizure, is it common that it occurs so frequently. Also, do you think this medicine or some other if this one does not work will make this more manageable? Thank you in advance.","Hello, I would explain that if Capital leads to improvement of your symptoms, this would be indicative that your symptoms are related to seizures.  You should know that there are many types of seizures, including those with hearing voices or noises, without loss of conscience.

Could you pls suggest","Hi...1-2 days of fever is usually viral in origin, and the important thing is that it will be recurrent as you have pointed in your complaint. But I suggest you certain facts regarding viral illness. When you give paracetamol and when the fever comes down for few hours, if the kid is active at that time, then you need not worry. Only Paracetamol will do every 4-6th hourly and that too only if temperature is more than 100 F.Apart from this give him plenty of water. Regards -"
I stopped taking a new birth control about a month ago because it was making me feel sick and about a month after to the day that I began taking it I had a horrible migraine headache and anxiety attack. I went to the dr and had blood work and the only thing that showed up was I had a vitamin d deficiency and my cholesterol is a bit elevated. I only bleed for one day while on this new pill and have missed a period all together. I have had 2 other attacks since I stopped taking the pill but no one has given me an explanation as to what it could be. I dont know if its linked to the change in hormones or the vitamin D issue,"Welcome to Chat Doctor.Don't worry, you can take very low dose oral contraceptive pill for birth control. Ask your doctor about this pill. There are certain medicines to control for migraine and anxiety. You have to be careful with vitamin D level. Take D3 60k tablet every week with warm milk. Take morning sun bath regularly. Start exercise, yoga. Avoid stress, anxiety. Also avoid oily, junk food(high calorie diet)Keep in touch with your doctor."
"Doctor pescribed Monticope for my child of age 2 and 8 mnths,,he advised us to avoid dust,pollens,pets,perfumes,smoke..But my question here is tht we use at night goodnight mosquito liquid,,will this mosquito liquid repellent act as allergen mentioned above..kindly let me know..","Although practically any substance can act as allergen, I do not think that you need to fear about allergy due to mosquito repellents as these are widely tested before the product is launched, and generally no reaction is seen. Those who are allergic to certain things may not be allergic to certain other things, so chances are that he would not be allergic to the mosquito repellents. This can only be confirmed after you apply it at least a small amount. In case you observe any reactions, you can stop using it."

Is there any side effect for using myteka for such a long time? and may i use this tablet further?","Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. First, to ad Chat Doctor.  Common side effects are headache, nausea, stomach upset, etc. If you are not experiencing it, you can continue taking it.2. Were I treating you, I would suggest you allergy testing which will help you identify the substances causing allergies to you and also to know the measures to avoid them. As you get more symptoms at night, I would think of allergy to house dust mites and indoor molds first. Based on allergy testing report, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to improve allergy symptoms gradually over a long period.3. I would also suggest you regular breathing exercises and a healthy diet which will improve your lung capacity and immunity respectively.4. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you the best of the health. Thank you & Regards."
"my girlfriend s daughter, who is 9 years old all of a sudden has got high temperature and fell asleep. My girlfriend did not measure her temperature and decided to leave her sleep if her temperature goes down. I insist that she takes her temperature but she does not. The girl almost never gets sick. What can it be? What should her mother do?","Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health."

"Hi, Im a 29yrs old and have been on zoloft since I was 18 yrs old. I use to have such a high libido before the meds and enjoyed and thought about having sex everyday. I used to have so much fun. Ive recently married my husband March this but we have been together for 11 years. I love him so much but sex doesnt interest me at all. Im never in the mood, but I want to enjoy one of the best pleasures life again. Another factor is that Im a stripper in a no touching club. But we met each other at the same club he was my manager and we worked together for 3 years and have lived with each other for years. I was diagnosed with bipolar at age 18/19 as I was admitted to a mental hospital by force as I was very suicidal. I think that being on zoloft at the start helped. Well its kept me somewhat sane. However Im still experiencing anxiety and depression. I used to love sex and being impulsive and now I just dread sex and I feel numb but I want to, I dont what to do. I have sex with my husband like once every two months. I feel like I dont even know how have sex anymore. Is there a better antidepresent  as I feel like Ive missed out on best years of  my life. Im a stripper that cant even initiate sex with my own partner. Why? Should I just get off zoloft. I want my happiness back. What can I do to get myself in the zone as I feel like we have never had proper sex. Is there any drugs I can take to bring my libido back.

"hello doctor.. my daughter is 2.5 years old. In march2012, she was having breath problem. then our doctor give treatment through nobalize. Now she is suffering from cold . then i went to doctor for checkup. He gave us inhaler for her. Is it safe to use inhaler for 2.5 years old baby. and i want to ask that if we use inhaler now then it will be habbit for her to use inhaler...plz suggest me.","Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Your daughter aged 2.5 years age had breathing problem then she was given treatment with nebulizer, now when she got cold was given inhaler. Both are same by function depending on age the doctors prefer the type.  Inhalers are of several types, broadly bronchodilator and steroid.  Broncho dilators we should use to get relief, steroids are used only when the severity of the infection is more. Steroids are to be used rarely when ever there is necessary.  Breathing problem usually develops due to allergy, and if you could find the allergen you can greatly minimize the severity of the attack. Allergens can be traced by making a list of the things used and foods on daily basis. Note when there is cold or cough. Try to find out the things used on the day of the attack of cold and avoid such things which are common.  Besides I advise you some diet recommendations as avoid taking brinjal, fish, other seafoods, ice water, ice cream, cool Chat Doctor.  Don't allow her to play with water.

"me and my wife came to know that she is pregnant 3 days back.when her urine routine was done ,the report shows pus cells 4-6 and epil. cells 2-3.the doctors has prescribed ceftum 500 twice a day for 5 days.i would like to know whether it is safe to take this?","Hello Sir, and I hope I can help you todayCeftum is a kind of antibiotic that is a cousin of penicillin, and can be safely taken during pregnancy as can all penicillin-based antibiotics. So you do not need to worry about your wives pregnancy from the medication the doctor prescribed. However, to properly treat a urine infection the dosing of the medication is typically 500 mg three or four times daily rather than just twice. If your wife completes the medication and her next urine test still shows white blood cells (plus) it should be cultured for bacteria to make sure that the infection is gone, because this dose of septum is frequently not strong enough to properly treat the infection, even in a pregnant woman. So in summary, it certainly is safe to take the prescribed medication for your wife during the pregnancy, and her doctor should consider increasing the dose if the suspected urine infection does not resolve within a few days. I hope that I was adequately able to answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. Best wishes,"

"I started smoking weed when i was 13. It was not a common thing, maybe once a week if that. After a HORRIBLE trip using a gravity bong, i made a pact with god that if he let me live i would never smoke again..And i didnt until a year ago. A year ago (im now 17) ...i was suffering from extreme depression . My new boyfriend at the time, now fiance, smoked weed everyday all day and after convincing me it would heal all my problems i decided to smoke. Everything was wonderful and life started to seem better and i fell in love with smoking weed until recently. In september i got strept and it went downhill from here. It was a normal day (besides the strept)..I smoked and i had a panic attack (heart racing, irrational thoughts, thought i was going to die, ect.)..Not sure what the cause of the panic attack was, i smoked again the next day and it happened again. I decided to wait until the strept was gone to smoke again thinking maybe it was because my immune system being weak. So after a week of waiting, i smoked 2 hits and here came the panic attack. I than decided i was done smoking weed for good. THe panic attacks were to much to handle and extremely scary. The last time i smoked was 9/25/09. I do not miss smoking and dont crave for it but im having constant panic attacks and insane anxiety. Everyday i wake up and it seems to be getting worse. I went to the doctors yesterday and they gave me 2 month samples of lexapro which is an anti- depressant and is supposed to helpwith anxiety attacks . I took my first dose last night and WILL NOT continue taking them. IT was awful, the anxiety and panic attacks were increased by 100. My doctor told me it takes a few weeks for your body to regulate and not to give up, but i cannot deal with these symptoms for a few weeks., Since stopping, my world view is completely off. I feel disconnected from the world. I am here, am able to talk and function but the way i see things is just weird and that scares me the most. I just want to feel normal...and i feel like the way im seeing things is wats offsetting my attacks to begin with. Ill start to think about why im seeing things the way i am, and than my heart starts racing and than its a full blown attack. After reading ALOT on this, i know im not alone and that has actually helped me remain calm all day today. How long is it going to take for my brain to get back to its normal state and for me to start seeing the world normally again? IM going to start excersing and eating correctly and i think that will help alot (one less thing to be concerned about). I appreciate any similar experiences with weed causing anxiety and having panic attacks/distorted views after quitting and of course any advice on what i can do!","Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your query. Cannabis (Weed) abuse is associated with a variety of psychiatric problems, and anxiety / panic attacks are indeed very commonly reported adverse after effects. The feeling of disconnection from the world (termed as """"derealization"""") is also another symptom frequently associated with cannabis abuse. Cannabis can also result in an """"unmasking"""" or triggering of underlying anxiety-related problems. Learn (Escitalopram) is an SSRI medication effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders, but like your doctors have mentioned, some people can experience a transient worsening of anxiety in the first 1 to 2 weeks. There are other antianxiety medication which may not have this side effect and can help you. There are also many psychological therapies which can help you deal with the anxiety. So, please consult your doctor regarding further treatment options. Wish you all the best."

I can understand your concern. You have slightly low WBC count.  Your platelet count is also at low normal range.  Most common cause is viral infection.  If you have no symptoms then no need to worry.  No need to consult hematologist. Just go for repeat blood test after a week.  If you have abnormal results then consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Right now no treatment is required. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
"This is regarding to my Grand mother who old 70 years and suffering from stomach ache and vomit sensations from the past 2 months and lost 13kg.. Undergone a surgery on 20th Oct to remove a tumour (not related to any cancer ) as identified by the AIG (Asian Institute of Gasterology) doctors, Hyderabad. During Surgery doctors came to know that it is a Cancer and cant remove from her stomach as it is spreaded to liver, beside there was a jaundice and a bypass was happened in the same surgery to control it. Now the doctors suggested to contact a oncologist , understand from the oncologist that it was Cancer related to Pancreatic and ended at liver and in final stage, suggested to go with Chemotherapy , Considering her age and the above problems, Can we go ahead with this chemotherapy at this moment ??? Got to know that Chemo is very difficult to handle and the survival chances are very less. or else Can we proceed with any Ayurvedic/Homeo. Please suggest. Thanks in advance, Krishna Chalapathi. +91-0000. YYYY@YYYY","Dear Mr Krishna, Sorry to hear about your grandmother. Unfortunately pancreatic cancer is a bad disease, especially if it has spread to the liver. Current focus of treatment is to give her good quality of life for her remaining life (typically 3-6 months). Chemotherapy rarely produces good response in these cases and is associated with a lot of side effects, especially at this age. Keeping these in mind I would just recommend supportive care for her. You can certainly proceed with alternative treatment, but we are no experts on those. Regards."

Continue the treatment you are taking. Don't take stress about the result. It will come positive soon. You should be happy with positive attitude.  Precautions are - -you should avoid contact with your husband.-don't lift heavy weights and do vigorous housework or fast climbing staircase.-don't do vigorous exercise like running and skipping and all. Walking is better and daily up to 45 mins you can do. There are no specific food to avoid or eat. You can eat what all you like to eat. Avoid papaya fruit which is supposed to induce abortion in early period. Hope I have been helpful. Regards Chat Doctor."
"hello, i just had a double mastectomy with following reconstruction. I have spacers in and just had 1 fill so far of 60cc. I am now facing chemo. My tumor was her2 positive but stage 1 and only 1 cm. My nobes was clear of no cancer. Why am I having to have chemo (6) sessions?","Any breast cancer 1 cm or more in size needs systemic therapy. Your tumor is Her2 new positive which makes it an aggressive tumor. Since You have not mentioned, I presume the tumor to be estrogen and progesterone receptor negative which rules out hormonal therapy. So the systemic therapy in your case has to be chemotherapy to kill any residual or circulating microscopic tumor cells which may not be visible on imaging at present. I hope your query has been answered."
"Hi Sir, I am 29 years old woman and maried in Feb 2010. I faced three abortion, first two was after completion of tree months but no heart beat and the third one was only after 40 days. Doctor said for so many test including Torch, VDRL, APLA, ACA IgM etc... all the reports are normal except ACA IgM, the value of ACA IgM was 30.97...

My doctor says that next time when you will get pregnant, you have to take injection, is the only treatment for you.. and also suggested to take ecosprin 75 mg continue...  Is there any treatment to reduce the value of ACA IgM.. Is it confirm the this is the only reason for my abortions. and is there any treatment in Homeopathic for this...????","Hi, Thanks for visiting Chat Doctor. Lupus anticoagulants are the frequent cause of recurrent abortions. And moreover you have got this antibody-positive. The preferred treatment modalities include the daily aspirin and injectable anticoagulants. Oral anticoagulant like warfarin is contraindicated as may lead to birth defect in fetus. Other possibilities of recurrent abortion is due to structural abnormality of female genital tract, infections like TORCH, APA etc...but all have been ruled out by subsequent tests. Here your doctor is very right in his work up plan and his prescription. It's a matter of ifs and buts... I will advise you to follow him and leave everything to almighty... Best wishes."
"Hello Sir, my wife was facing a problem of Periods irregularity and consulted doctor. The doctor suggested Novelon for three weeks. today she started taking the pill . But I have noticed that in the medicine booklet it has mentioned that persons using this pill often found to diagnose with breast cancer in future life. Sir, I want to know whether this pill is dangerous ?","Hi, Novelon is an oral contraceptive pill which contains both estrogen and progesterone(ethanol estradiol 0.03 mg, desogestrel 0.15 mg). It is having side effects like, Weight gain, Headache, dizziness, Nausea,Breast tenderness and enlargement, Cramping abdominal pain, Change in appetite, vomiting, Vaginal spotting etc. According to some studies oral contraceptives may cause estrogen dependent cancers like breast cancer.

My sister is 55 years old diagnosed with adenocarcinoma with unkown origin.  She has lost a lot of weight and swollen feet due comprassion of tumors on her digestive and lower body system. Few days ago doctor started first treatment of Chemotherapy with a little hope as he stated. Is there any medicine or therapy can open her digestive system and ease the comprassion on her lower body so she can start eating and walk again on her own for better chance of her system to fight the disease?? Thanks,"Loss of appetite in cancer patients is due to poor intake by cancer patients as they will not be able to take adequately due to lack of appetite. Also, the nutritional demands are high as the cancer cells have rapid turnover. Swelling is because of compression over blood vessels Chat Doctor.  Also low intake of protein causes body swelling. Her condition can be improved by 1) good nutrition including high calorie and high protein diet. Certain medications can help improve appetite 2) If the tumor regresses in size, pressure effects would decrease and limb swelling would decrease. This can be achieved by chemotherapy"

I can understand your concern. Pet scan is diagnostic for many lung diseases. Since you are saying that spots on PET scan are having holes, possibility of cavitary lung lesions is more in your fathers case. Following are the possible causes for such lesions. 1. Tuberculosis 2. Fungal pneumonia. 3. Cavitary carcinoma 4. Lung metastases 5. Cystic lung diseases like bronchiectasis. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query.

Your doctor prescribed the right antihypertensive for you. You need not concern too much about this. As for as dose of perindopril is concerned, he may increase or decrease the dose of perindopril based on your blood pressure control and nothing to worry about. There is no interaction between Perindopril and imaging. Other than perindopril most of the antihypertensives like calcium channel blockers, metoprolol etc. have significant interaction with Imaging.Thus, nothing to be concerned too much about this. Just have regular check on your blood pressure. Have a regular visit and consult your treating oncologist. Hope this helps. Please write back for further queries. Wishing you good health."
"Hi. I noticed that I shaved my legs about 2 weeks ago, and very very little hair has grown back, and what has grown back is very thin, and in patches. Also, the hair on my head has suddenly gotten drastically shorter, yet I see no hairs falling or coming out.

Lately, Ive been thinking about getting a Liver cleanser (all natural) to perform at home.","Hi, Before taking any supplement as liver cleanser, you should make sure you have liver problems by checking the blood transaminase. Furthermore, thin hair and in patches could also be a sign of vitamins deficiencies (it. D, E,etc.). You can take multivitamins supplements containing it.

"I have a question. Suppose youre taking birth control and 9 days before your due period you forget to take a pill for 3 days. You take those pills as instructed, but you have unprotected sexual intercourse 3 days before your due period. Is it possible to get pregnant even though youre not ovulating? Or will stopping pill use before youre supposed to get your period going to make you ovulate?","Hello, Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. I have gone through your query and here are some suggestions. 1. Missing three pills in a row makes the cycle unsafe. Additional protection is needed. 2. Pregnancy is not possible without ovulation. An intercourse just before the onset of the period is not likely to cause conception because even if you ovulated in the cycle, you were likely to be in the safe period. 3. Ovulation with abrupt stoppage of the pill is unpredictable. Hope you find this information useful. Take care."

Thanks for posting your concern at ChatDoctorSeborrhoeic dermatitis OR Dan Chat Doctor. Clinically it presents as itchy, ill-defined erythematous lesions with adherent greasy and yellowish scaling which when scrapped or picked with nails oozes sticky liquid. Keeping the scalp clean with either daily OR alternate day shampooing and avoidance of greasy products on scalp helps in resolving the condition. I advise my patients of seborrhea dermatitis to use an antifungal shampoo twice OR thrice weekly(can also be used once OR even twice daily depending upon the requirement). If shampoo is not enough I ask my patient to use a topical steroid lotion twice daily for 2-4 weeks. Once the scaling and erythema subsides it is important to stop the steroid lotion but continue with an antifungal shampoo for maintaining the improvement. Take care regards"

Strict 500 (Capitoline) is safe to your mother, so also are Gawain and Joint ace DN. These will not cause her any harm. Paracetamol or Nootropic 800 is not to be used in renal impairment or decreased renal function as in your mothers case. Please discuss this with her treating doctor. Mental is a herbal product, I cannot comment on this since I am an allocate. However, clinical studies have not shown any adverse effects in normal patients. The shoulder pain your mother is suffering from, most probably seems like an acute exacerbation of Osteoporosis. I am sorry that she is suffering these ailments. In case of severe pain please give her paracetamol 500 mg tablet which is available over the counter. As age progress, the cognitive functions of brain decrease. Please accept that and take good care of your mother. Hope I have answered your query. All the best."

Typhoid is a bacterial infection and stays in the body till treated completely in most individuals. It is important to know what antibiotics you are taking, its dosage and duration for which you have been prescribed. Most likely, you are getting cured and for complete cure you must take medications as suggested by your doctor. The main precaution you must take at present is eat healthy home cooked food with less oil and no spices. This diet may be continued for about a month to allow proper recovery. Medications also must be taken for complete course and in typhoid it is often given for 14 days. You may take adequate amounts of water and fresh fruit juices. As typhoid leaves you very weak, taking rest for a while is advised. Typhoid recovery is not the same in every person who gets it. Thank you."
"Hello. My 2 year old has had a recurring fever that sometimes isn t treatable with ibuprofen or Tylenol, and has been vomiting several times throughout the day. He had the same issue about a week ago, but it went away within a few days and his Pedi said it was just a tummy bug, and to just let it pass. This time is a little different because one of his cheeks is bright red and hot to the touch. I m worried this could be something more, possibly? Should I just let this pass as his Pedi recommended last week or is this something worthy of making an appointment for? Thank You.","Hi... your pediatrician was right. I, too, feel that this is a passing viral illness. Recurrent viral illness is very common in this age group and season. I will explain to you how are viral illness behaves so that you can be more confident. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Regards -"

"Hello doctor, My name is XXXXX, 22 year old female, recently injured my back falling down stairs. I worked out a couple days later and immediately got numbness and excruciating pain radiating through my hips and down my legs. Went to urgent care and the physician said in my x rays everything looked normal except maybe a slight tilt in coccyx which the radiologist ruled as normal. It s very painful to walk sit or stand up but the physician just prescribed a muscle relaxer and anti inflammatory. Should I still go see an orthopedic or wait to see if the pills fix the issue? Thank you!",Thanks for the query. Do you still have numbness and pain along the leg? Back muscle sprain is usually cause back pain but not the leg pain or numbness in the leg. Do you have specific tenderness along the spine? It may be simple muscle sprain but if you're still having leg complaints then I would investigate further. Get examined by an orthopedic doctor. I would like to rule out the disc prolapse. Thanks.

Have NMO. Currently taking chemo. Had lost sight in left eye than in right. Right eye had improved for a while but just 2 days ago both eyes seemed to have some activity and now the right eye has gone to black. Have you heard of the vision getting worse before better?,"Hi, Thanks for writing in. Chemotherapy for Neuromyelitis optical can have different responses in different patients and variable responses in the same patient under different circumstances. It looks like the chemotherapy is showing variable response in your case. The improvement and worsening of vision depends on the recovery of the optic nerves and the surrounding swelling. When chemotherapy is given then there can be some initial swelling of optic nerve sheath and this can cause temporary worsening of vision. This can then improve slowly with time as the chemotherapy response gets better. Therefore, the initial worsening can be due to the swelling of the nerves and with continued treatment this will improve. However, since vision is an important area therefore please discuss in detail with your doctor. Please do not worry."
I have chronic hep C and my enzymes have tripled in the last year. Trying to figure out why? I stopped taking oxycotin and started taking tramadol? I also started taking time released 5HTTP? My stress level is through the roof but I think I read stress does not affect hep c?,Serotonin or 5HTTP might be the cause of increase in your liver enzymes. It is metabolized in the liver and this could cause an elevation of your liver enzymes.

Wait for 3 weeks after stopping 5HTTP and then retest your liver enzymes.  If your liver enzymes are still elevated you need to go to a gastroenterologist who will do a whole panel of tests for HEPA

On the other side he has lost his physical and emotional balance. He is under a Neurologist but progress is nothing. Plz advise me.kind regards,Bijan","Hello! Welcome to Chat Doctor and thank your for your question! I understand your concern, and would explain that these are common symptoms after brain stroke (also called pseudo Bulgar palsy). Unfortunately there are no specific medications, which are proved to improve this situation. The best therapy in this case would be physiotherapy and psychotherapy. Recovery after stroke takes time. It is greatest in the first few months, and gradually plateaus, although small gains may be made for the next 1 to 2 years. I recommend continuing the anti vomiting medications(besides the other antihypertensive and prevention therapy) and try time after time to make proves if he can swallow without vomiting (some patients remain with a feeding tube for months). A psychiatric consult may be needed to establish the proper therapy for his mood changes. Many persons have depression after stroke, which makes their recovery more difficult.

Also, because you are eager to conceive and since it's a contraceptive pill it will prevent you from conceiving. It is very unlikely that you are pregnant while on crimson, less than 1% chance of it.Moreover, in women with PCs who would like to conceive other options such as camphene, inositol should be considered. Crimson would not be the ideal Chat Doctor. Hope this helps. Regards."
My angioplasty with two stnts were done on 13th Dec 2013. The doctor gave me among other medicines the following: ecospirin325 clopitab 75 ( combo of atenol and amlodipine) Earlier i was taking Aten 50 and Amolopress L since 2003 when I developed AMI Since last two weeks I have observed swelling on my feet.

However, the dose since 2003 is the same.  If your hemoglobin and s albumin is normal, get a 2d echo done see what your heart pumping, if on the lower side, what is the diastolic dysfunction.  If all normal adding a small dose of diuretic will help, e.g. chlorthalidone 6.25 mg to your antihypertensive regime. Regards"

My daughter 34yrs old was taking prodep 20mg for a few days fro depression and stopped as she felt better. after two days she develpoped a severe pain in the wrist and after taking priodep she got immense relief..Is there any connection/ pl. let me know. sheela,"Dear Mrs. Sheila went through your query and appreciate your concern for your daughter. Proper is Fluoxetine which is an anti-depressant medication. Anti-depressant medications should be continued for few months even after the patient feels alright in order to prevent any relapse or recurrence of symptoms. Her having pain in wrist might be a result of discontinuation effect of fluoxetine. Whenever the anti-depressant medications have to be stopped, they should be tapered and with Chat Doctor. In your daughters case, I would advise that you discuss with the psychiatrist about continuation of fluoxetine. I do hope that I was able to help with your problem. Best wishes,"

Any other alternative which cure and treat my asthma . Few have suggested that i should quit my all inhaler .Please suggest if there are any side effects of using inhaler for long term .","Hello dear, Asthma is caused due to bronchoconstriction (obstruction of smaller airway passages) which is indicative of Hyper-responsiveness of air passages. Budamate and Saltier inhaler-provide symptomatic relief by causing bronchodilator (dilating the smaller airway passages)Being administered through inhalation route, they have minimal side effects and can be used in the long term. Additional management consists of:1. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of asthma.2. Antihistamines like Cetirizine can also be used to provide symptomatic relief.3. Need for anti bionics can arise if there is a secondary infection.4. Also make sure that you are well protected from exposure to cold, dust or other allergens. As the condition is related to hyper-sensitivity of your immune response, it can only be managed symptomatically. Complete cure will need complete shut down of your immune mechanism, which will make you prone for severe life-threatening secondary infections. So, kindly continue the medications as prescribed by your treating Doctor. Wishing you a good health. Take care."
I was diagnosed with ureaplasma and have started taking antibiotics. I have had unprotected sex only once with my new partner before that and dont want to mention the diagnosis.

Now, my wife is suffering with heavy bleeding and she is complaining of heavy pain below the stomach. We would like to know if there is any home remedy to reduce the pain?Thanks in advance.",", don't try any home remedies now. Have an immediate visit to your obstetrician this heavy bleeding is due to abortion of the fetus. All the time it might not have aborted fully, and she may need Dilatation and Curettage.  Any left out contents inside the uterus will cause severe bleeding. So immediate medical attention is needed. Natural remedies will not work this time. Hope this explains. With Regards Chat Doctor."

"I was bitten two days ago by a fire ant, three times on my middle toe on my left foot. It became inflamed and red very quickly. I used benadryl, it stopped the itching. Yesterday morning the swelling had spread to all 4 small toes and into my foot. My doctor prescribed prednisone and topical steroid cream. Also told me to take zyrtec or clariton over the counter. I took the steroid and it seemed to reduce the swelling but by the evening two of the insect bites were black and the surrounding area was also black and swollen. I soaked my foot in epsome salts that helped the pain and reduced the redness and swelling some. Today the bites are still very black and swollen but not exceptionally painful. Should I be concerned? Should I lance them and soak again?","Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor It would be best not to puncture them because they can introduce infection if the technique is not sterile. You may want to add anti-inflammatory painkillers to your current regimen. They would help with pain relief and also reduce the inflammation due to the bites. Examples are ibuprofen, naproxen should continue your other medication and can also the foot baths. It is possible that the bites may become infected so if there is no improvement you may need a course of antibiotics. I hope this helps"

There can be nerve irritation due to post surgery injury. I t can be due to compression of nerve root or entrapment of nerve. You can take vitamin B12 for reducing symptoms. Vitamin B12 is important in the maintenance of health and normal functioning of the nerve tissue and deficiency of it can lead to numbness. You can increase B12 level by taking meat and fish, or you can take In methylcobalamine 1500 mcg If not relieved then I will advise you to MRI spine and EMG/CV [nerve conduction study for better diagnosis.

"i hav a 11 yrs old daughter who got  disabled at the time of birth due to cord rounded around her neck. her survival was not complete and now she is a special child. she is completely bed ridden and dependent on liquid or mashed diet. she is bed ridden can not hold her neck and also feels fits. she passes stool after 6-7 days. she is on medicines like revotril drops, tab topamax.kindly suggest balanced diet for her particularly to keep her fresh and avoid constipation","Hello dear! I can understand your concern as I am a mother too. It feels heartbroken to see your child in misery. I would advise you to make a diet chart based on her caloric requirement according to her current weight and considering the ideal weight at this age. Suppose at this age, she should have a weight of at least 35 kg, which I am sure she wont be. So you should start with LEAST 60% of the required calories of this weight that is 1800 calories (60% would be around 1000 calories)I am making a sample of diet chart which you can give to her and gradually increasing calories. Starting from 8 am give her whole egg in the form of a purée made with poring egg in about 5 ounces of boiled milk and gradually stirring with a whisk.it will be like a custard. Add in 2 teaspoons of sugar and a Chat Doctor. At 10 am you can give chicken stock made with about a 100 gm of chicken in water with selected spices like black pepper or paprika and salt, whichever she likes.it will provide around 150 calories save the meat of chicken and blend it with a cup of wheat cereal with a little stock if remaining)it will provide around 250 calories. At 12 noon you can give about a cup of rice pudding made with 4-5 ounces of boiled rice and 8-10 ounces of milk with added sugar if she likes and a cardamom to enhance the flavor. It will provide around 200-250 calories.at 2 pm you can give her mashed veggies like a mashed potato medium-sized.you can also grill with butter and sprinkle some salt and then mesh it with chicken stock or milk or anything you like. It will provide around 150 calories and with added butter and stock around 250-300 calories. At 4 pm repeat the wheat and chicken stock (wheat cereal/oatmeal is high in fiber to avoid constipation). At 6 pm give her banana shake.2 bananas in 5-6 ounces of milk, it will provide around 200 calories. At 8 pm give her lentil soup (about 100 grams) with selected spices. It will provide around 250 calories in almost a cup of 5-6 ounces. At 10 pm repeat rice pudding At 12 midnight give her warm milk about 5-6 ounces with a tablespoon of olive oil. It will enhance the calories and relieve constipation. Hope it will help. You can always make variations in the diet with the choice of ingredients. Wishing your child good health :-)"

"I m 39 and have been taking diovan for high blood pressure for 4 years. This past year I have gained about 30 pounds and I have had 2 or 3 episodes of high blood pressure. One example, I started having a headache after lunch and by 5pm I was at ER with 200/101. Doctors did several EKG s, blood work, stayed over night for stress test next morning, echocardio gram, xrays...etc. I followed up with cardiologist who suggested diet changes and recording BP. So now for about 3 months all has been good, but the last 2 days I am experiencing another episode . Headaches with 135/99 and 141/96. Could this be related to my menstrual cycle? I just ended this month s cycle. Just looking for answers that maybe could be related to something else.","Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I understand your concern and would explain that the headaches do not seem to be related to high blood pressure, as your actual blood pressure values are within the normal ranges or slightly elevated. In my opinion the headaches could be related to the menstrual cycle or tension type headache. For this reason, I would recommend trying acetaminophen or ibuprofen for the headaches. Regarding high blood pressure values, I would recommend trying to lose some pounds and perform a lot of physical activity in order to have lower blood pressure values naturally. Reducing salt and caffeine intake would also help. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Best wishes,"

Global question: Does Focalin help kids, mediate symptoms, who do not have ADHD?","Hello there, Thank you for your question and welcome to Chat Doctor. To answer your question about Focal in, the half life is about 8 hours. It also depends on how long the child has been on the medication. If the child has been on it for several years, it will take a longer amount of time to be fully out of his system. If he was on it for 6 months or less, he should be clean after about 16 hours. You are correct about it being short-acting. Hopefully this answers your question. Have a good day!"

"yesterday I had hardened skin over muscles where the backbone ends (gluteus maximus muscles I guess) in my buttocks. No pain, not really itchy. For the previous 1-2 days I ate a lot of pastries with wallnuts and sugar in it. I also have some kind of arthristis in my joints (a rheumatologist from Istanbul is trying to diagnose at the moment - she says it may be spondillitis). Back to my hardened skin, I took a claritine (10 mg) last night and it looks like it is almost totally gone. Why did that happen? It was first time in my life.","Hi Hope this message finds you in good health. Such kind of hardened skin occurs due to para spinal muscle spasm.

Taking muscle relaxant tablets will help. Hope your query has been answered back to me for any doubts that you may have. Kind Regards"

I dont have any liver disease and i dont have any problem in pregnancy. I took progesterone tab until 12 weeks of pregnant.,"Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. I am Chat Doctor, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.GOT and SGPT are sensitive indicators of liver damage or injury from different types of diseases or conditions, and collectively they are termed liver tests or liver blood tests. So the next step is to look for certain liver damage and most common case is fatty liver disease. It should be confirmed by ultrasound. Other causes are viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, medications, alcohol intake or autoimmune diseases. To verify exact cause, US, bilirubin levels and tumor markers should be additional done Then appropriate treatment can be started. I hope I have answered you query.

"hi I recently went for my mirena coil to be replaced the doctor told me I had a polyp on my cervix and has arranged for me to have it removed. They replaced my coil. Can you tell me is there a risk of cervical cancer, all my previous smears have always been clear I am 39","Hi, Thanks for writing in. A polyp is usually a benign finger like outgrowth. It is at the cervix in your case and should be removed and seen under the microscope. While over 95 percent of polys in the cervix are benign and harmless in nature still 5 percent can get converted to a malignancy. Your doctor has suggested right to get the polyp removed and then checked for any signs of malignancy. Please get the polyp removed and discuss the histopathology report with your doctor. It is most likely that your polyp will turn out to be benign and harmless. Surgery is advised in every patient with a polyp so that in the rare event of a malignant polyp, treatment ca be given at the earliest. Please do not worry."

My husband went to the Dr. today and found out that his ALT (SGPT) Was 132 and his Alt (SGOT) was 188. He is an alcoholic and has been drinking more liquor than beer lately. What does this mean? I think he is in worse shape than he thinks and I am worried.,"HelloYour husband findings suggests increased SGPT and GOT level. Increased SGPT indicates liver injury, and it may be due to many reasons like hepatitis, alcohol intake, altered lipid profile, medicines,autoimmune causes etc. Increased SGPT in his case may be due to alcohol intake. Increased GOT is non-specific, and it increases in many conditions. He needs few other investigations like viral markers, lipid profile and ultrasound of abdomen. He may need to take some medicines after proper evaluation. I suggest my patients to take tablet ursodeoxycholic acid 300 mg twice daily for three months. It helps in regeneration of liver cells. He should avoid alcohol completely. Get well soon. Take Care Chat Doctor."

hey i just had a sugery to remove my galbladder after they found small stones in it. I was prescribed tylenol 3 to ease the pain but the pain is still a bit strong at the moment. My sugery was 10 hours ago. would taking marijana be more of a con than pro at this time to help ease the pain?,Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for the query. Marihuana is not justified as analgesia method so from out point you should not take it especially not so early after surgery.

So if you need more analgesia consult your doctors about it and take some regular painkillers Wish you good health. Regards

"On sat night after brushing my teeth , I noticed my lower gums started to bleed . Since then, they have continued to bleed with brushing. The underneath part of my tongue feels very painful, like a burning sensation as well as the tip of my tongue. After brushing this morning, one tooth on each side...towards the back look as if I brushed off part of the gum! I was on antibiotics for 5 weeks due to a severe dog bite, but have been off of them for 3 weeks now. I have an appt tomorrow with a periodontist, but am seeking some type of clarification since my mouth has been hurting for 5 days now with no relief :0( I should also add that its been several years since I ve been to a dentist , due to extreme fear, high anxiety and I even fainted once walking into a dentist office. But at this point, it s a necessity to go. Thank you!","Hi. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor forum, I have read your concern. As you c/o bleeding while brushing teeth, your gums may be highly inflamed, ie, gingivitis. The gum infection may be due to-Plaque and food debris accumulation as a result of poor oral hygiene maintenance. Systemic diseases like diabetes mellitus, hypertension,epilepsy, autoimmune diseases. Improper brushing techniques.First I want to tell you that please do not be panic regarding dental treatments. If your dentist is doing any procedure, which will be painful, then surely he/she will administer local anesthetic solution. Meanwhile, brush your teeth twice daily in proper manner. Get your teeth cleaned by your dentist. Include plenty of nutritious rich food into your diet. Bleeding from gums will stop, once the plaque underneath the gums are removed and gums become intact, firm again. HOPE THIS HELPS.TAKE CARE."
"Hi my mum has stage four bowel cancer which has spread to the liver and to the peretoneum. Operations weren t an option as the cancer has spread too far, she tried chemo back in November but was no point in continuing as the pain and after effects were too horrific. She is doing really good seeing as her oncologist said she should be dead by now, mum feels it is the supplements that are helping to boost her immune system . Her feet have become quite swollen the last few days, is this from the tumours and part of the body breaking down or is it more circulation and she needs to try and move her feet more? thank you","Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. I am sorry that you're confronting with such serious disease, but I am glad that your mum feels good. It is always hard to predict every malignant disease. Swollen legs can be caused by tumor pressure on pelvic veins, and this isn't uncommon. But also you should look for heart and kidney disease because both can cause swollen feet. Whatever it is she should lie with elevated leg, can put some pillow underneath and do feet exercise. For the beginning blood pressure and echocardiography and basic labs would be good to evaluate kidney and heart function, although those swelling aren't going to hurt her very much if this isn't extreme. Wish you good health and good luck"

But if still pain is there it means there is some infection left there, and it should relieve. The medication you are taking is a painkiller with muscle relaxant, according to me, you should also start with antibiotic which will help you in healing. And also you should not continue with so much of doses of CIPRO, you should visit a good dentist to get a proper treatment."

"Can HSV 2 virus be cured 100%? during non outbreaks, is it safe to have unprotected sex with my partner? Can sanitary pads have an allergic reaction looking like blisters similar to HSV I requested the HSV test to be done when going to see my GP with regards to another ailment. My ex had affairs. He stated that I had HSV 1 (I can agree with this as I get the occasional cold sore on my lip) but stated that my HSV2 could be a Fals e positive. I have non whatsoever outbreaks, and the only ever time I got blisters was when wearing a sanitary towel, upper out area of my buttock, where the sanitary pad had contact with. GP said it could be a false positive, to repeat the test in 2 weeks time then. I read on the internet, yes that this can happen. A PCR test is the other test used to confirm, which I had routinely done at my GIT clinic recently, and it was normal. What would you please advise me?","HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor False positive tests can occur with any test, but the chance of a false positive can vary from one test to the other. You can consider repeating the test to see if it was inaccurate especially since another test had a negative results. There are some tests that have a high rate of accuracy, close to a 100%. The best would be an HSV western block test. In terms of curing this infection, it is not cured. Once a person has been infected, it is possible for transmission to occur both when a rash is present and also when they are no symptoms-asymptomatic transmission. I hope this helps"
"Started having anxiety August 2010, was put on Zoloft.  Terrible experience.  Met an OBGYN who recommended testing my hormones and told  me to get off of the Zoloft after one week.  Unfortunately hormones came out normal but we decided to try natural progesterone the second half of my menstural cycle.  Started at 15mg.  Second month they increased it to 30mg.  The month when I started the increased dose I started having intrustive thoughts about myself and my kids.  My other symptoms were cloudy thinking, tired, feeling claustrophobic, impatient with others.  I used the 30mg dose until January or February 2011 until I started feeling more sensitive vaginally and on my breasts.  It was a very uncomfortable feeling so I decreased my dose back down to 15mg.  Intrusive thoughts have improved and was seeing a behavioral therapist for awhile who treated me for depression.  I stay at home with my kids and have for 3 years. I met with a Naturopath MD in July 2011 because I was afraid of using an antidepressant again after my experience with Zoloft.  She put me on some tinctures to balance out my hormones, not add any and also a tincture for Adrenal fatigue.  I have felt better but the intrusive thoughts have not disappeared.  It varies month to month but typically happens around the same time of the month.  If its truly all hormonal then I guess I have to take one month at a time, but I do not like it.  What else can it be? and what naturally can I do about it? The Naturopath MD wanted me to try 5HTP but was going to wait until after the holidays.","Dear, A likely diagnosis of Obsessive compulsive disorder appears here.

I am 65 yrs of age and reciding in Pune India.

After taking Telma 40 again gidiness started and I stopped taking BP tablets since last one week and my present BP level is 120/80.

"I live in France. A sonogram detected a 19 mm polyp in my bladder in May. The scan was prompted by the presence of hematuria. This was followed by a thoracic, abdominal and pelvic MRI which detected no other abnormal growths. I completed a 2 year regimen of prednisone to control Hortons disease and feel that this was the causal factor for this growth. I finally weaned off the prednisone in August of this year. By utilizing some of the protocols of Drs Nicholas Gonzalez and James Forsythe I was able to stop the bleeding, but at a friends birthday party this past weekend I consumed about 2 ounces of champagne and the bleeding resumed with a vengeance. I am seeking an integrative oncologist in southern France. Can you recommend one?","Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, I will take an opportunity to give an opinion regarding your problem. Was the polyp removed from your bladder? If yes, was it examined microscopically? Hematuria is caused by different causes like disorders of kidney, bladder stones and growths in the bladder. Cystoscopically, a polyp is detected in the bladder. This polyp could be benign or could be malignant. This polyp needs to be removed and sent to a pathologist for microscopically examination. If no malignancy is detected no further treatment is required. If malignancy is present, surgery and/OE chemotherapy is required. So, first you need to consult a surgeon for removal of the polyp.

"I constantly itch on my hips, buttocks, inner thighs and scrotum.  The itching has turned into small red bumps with no discharge.

This happened to me about two and a half months ago, and while my doctor didnt completely agree that it was scabies, he still prescribed Permethrin.  This helped, and I washed everything in my home.  Now it is back.  Could this be an STD, and not Scabies?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  You are getting the itching all over the waist, the most probable cause may be the fungal infection called the ring worm.  It also may be the allergic reaction, due to some foods, cosmetics, soap, or the material of the undergarments.  I usually prescribe to my patient with such symptoms cetirizine, grisofulvin, and a cream containing a steroid, antifungal and antibacterial.  First time it is cured by permethrin, but at that also your doctor didn't agree, anyhow it is cured. Maybe it is scabies at that time.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Thank you."

"I juice everyday, take probiotics and blood pressure medicine. I am experiencing sudden hair loss.When I juice I do kale, berries, fresh ginger, honey, soy protein, 1/2 cup of Kefir and a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar.Vitamins I take are: Multi, B, C, D, Calcium, EPA. Could something I am taking be causing the problem?","Hi there,,,welcome to ChatDoctor-The diet you are following is good for hair growth and can not be the cause of your hairball.-Get your Hemoglobin and thyroid profile checked as these are some common cause of hairloss-Give your scalp a frequent hair massage with lukewarm olive and coconut oil with tip of fingers.this will increase the circulation of scalp and intern hair growth.- I want also to mention here that falling of up to 100 strands of hair/day is normal because every hair has a life cycle of its own which ends with it falling out to make space for new one to grow. Sometime people misunderstood this with hairball. Hope this will help"
"Dear Doctor,I have been feeling a burning sensation in my chest on and off over the past 1 week. My Bp reads normal which is between 120/77 to 135/80. I have visited 2 doctors who have both prescribed medication for gastric. I have no numb feeling however i do feel that my heart is beating rather fast at times. Appreciate your opinion on this.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern.

So avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm.Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."

"Hi.. My 54 year old husband was diagnosed with TB before and he took medicine for 9 months and was declared cleared.. Now for maybe 5 months now hes suffering from too much coughing .When I checked all the symptoms thru online it all state that he had  a chronic bronchitis.  There is a wheezing sound also when he coughs. He cough too much and the worst is that  sometimes he cannot breath.. Hes face is red and no air is coming out..The attacked sometimes last for few seconds..  Right now he is into Turbohaler 160/4.5ug/dose (2 puffs moring and evening) Doctor, Is there any other medicine he can take for this kind of sickness..Im really worried.. thanks a lot...","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, by his history and description, possibility of chronic bronchitis is more. Treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. And fir severity, PUT (pulmonary function test) is must. So first, get done PFT to know the severity of the disease. He may need newer longer acting inhaled bronchodilators like (indacaterol and glycopyrollium) for better symptomatic relief. Oral bronchodilator, acebrophyllin is also indicated in severe bronchitis. Oral antioxidants like n acetyl cysteine (NAC) is also beneficial in his case. Chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercises are also helpful in improving lung functions and reduce symptoms.

During the smear they said I was bleeding inside ( although period had been 2 weeks previous not period) and had discharge. They got a doc and prescribed antibiotics. Sex is extremely painful amd my lower abdomon is painful in a v shape what s going on? Thanks","HIT hank for asking to ChatDoctorI really understand your concern, if you have not completed the course of antibiotic then complete it, or if it is being completed then wait for few days I think this will come around, have bed rest no intercourse, if your symptoms appears again then it needs to be investigated for internal problem then taking any medicine would not advisable take care and have nice day."
"I have bilateral flank pain.  It started over a year ago. It will come and go.  It starts as a dull ache, radiating into bilareal pelvis.  It increases quickly from a dull ache to a sharp, throbbing pain.  It will start, I medicate with 600 to 800mg of ibuprofen.  Lately, I have to take 650MG of Tylenol WITH the ibuprofen to get it managable.  These attacks will last 3 to 6 days and not happen again for one to two months.  Each bout seems to be more intense.","Hello I have gone through your question and understand your concern. Chronic bilateral flank pain can originate from kidney, spine, muscle spasm, conditions affecting organs in abdomen and very rarely cardiac causes. Undergo the following test for better diagnosis, ultrasound abdomen and pelvis along with ECG, X-ray lumbosacral spine, complete urine examination, liver and kidney function test. Avoid taking heavy painkillers, only to worsen the problem if renal or liver pathology is the cause for pain as most of painkiller process in these organs. Use hot pad or pain relief ointments for local application if the above diagnostic tests are normal, in that case muscle spasm is likely to be the cause. Hope your concern is answered. Thank you."
"Hi my mum was diaganosed 4 years ago with follicular non hodgkins lymphoma and finished mab therapy last feb however 2 weeks ago she was told she has swollen glands due to the disease again and a gland in her neck swelled to a large size overnight, this lump is hard and painful. Is this lymphoma and this mean that it is becoming more aggressive, also what is expected life expectancy with this type of cancer . Thank you",The swelling appeared overnight may be secondary to the lymphoma your mother had. Since it is a large and hard mass it is probably a spread of the lymphoma and is of aggressive type. At this stage It's difficult to predict the expectancy because it may vary person to person. But theoretically she may have up to 2 years if she is retreated for the lymphoma. Retreatment also depends on her health status. I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for. Please feel free to write back to me for any further clarifications. I would gladly help you.  Best wishes.
"I have been diagnosed with PCOS in 2003. I was on medication (Diane 35 for 5 years and aldactone for 9 years). I was told to continue aldactone. In Feb this year I found a breast lump which was diagnosed as fibro adenoma . The doc said the lump may be because of aldactone. I have stopped all medication since Feb 2012. I had very irregular periods (once in 15 days). After stopping aldactone, I am getting almost regular periods. I have been TTC since Nov. 2011 and still no success. I am 26 years old now. BMI is 24.6. What steps should I take now to conceive normally?","Hi, Most important step is lifestyle modification: Healthy diet + at least 30 min. Of sweat inducing exercise daily. Since you are having irregular periods, you are not ovulating regularly for which you can take simple tablets after consulting you doctor. Another way is Laparoscopic ovarian puncture, which will resume ovulation in about 50% cases. But as laparoscopy is invasive operation, it's better to go for simple treatment first unless laparoscopy is indicated for other reasons."
"I believe that I have been around black mold. Both at work and home, plus I have a lot of stress. Currently my calves are covered in red swollen rash/bites. Plus the bumps have a lot of heat to them. And I keep running a high fever, due to the infection from the mold. With the heat in the rash can I use hydrocortisone cream?","Hello, The red swollen rash on your calves is a sign of allergic reaction to mold. You are already getting treated for mold infection. Please follow your doctors' advice rigorously. Yes, you can apply HY Chat Doctor.  Keep well cleaned the affected area. Raise your legs. Apply cold compresses locally. If no improvement, should consult with dermatologist to rule out possible infection. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."
"Hi, I have stuffy nose and congestion from past many days now and it does not seem to be common cold/flu as I was suspecting it. It seems like alergy to me which is common in Bangalore during this time. Last year my doctor prescribed Tab Montek LC (1 at Bed time for 3 days) and Tab Montek 10mg (1 at bedtime for 7 days). Along with this she also recommended Capsule Mucolite SR (three times a day for 3 days). And after three days, she asked me to continue the Montek LC for another 5 days. Unfortunately she is out of town now. Can I take the same medicine and dosage?","Hi there!I agree with you over the fact that allergy is common to Bangalore, however all attacks of cold/flu cannot be attributed to allergy. Morever indiscriminate use of anti allergic is not advisable. What I have seen in general is intensive steam inhalation using capsules of Karol plus along with tab ivory will bring you good relief. To confirm an allergic etiology to your cold you should check your serum IG e levels. If elevated they need to be monitored and specific antigen needs to be isolated for long term precautions and benefits.I would also recommend you getting yourself evaluated for chronic sinusitis as this also contributes to chronic cough and cold in many cases.

Hi Dr. G. Cat....10 yrs...diagnosed with tumors in her abdomin and one is impairing her walking skills. She has been perscribed prednisone and shes walking better but I would like something natural I can feed her to help shrink these evil things. Thanks for any help,"Dear, We are not clear about what type of tumor the patient has. According to my understanding prednisolone helps mainly in lymphomatous tumors. Boost her immunity with natural herbal products like wheatgrass so that she can resist the progression of disease. As such only prednisolone is not enough for tumor control, but your doctor must have assessed her and thought it worthwhile to put her on prednisolone only."
"I have the implanon implant for 2.5 years. I have had no bleeding what so ever until today, there s quite alot of blood & clots. I have stomach problems anyway, have had for a year & half. I also have 3 tiny ulcers . I just wanted to know whether it could be a period or not. I also feel dizzy & keep being sick, the sickness is normal since i had stomach pains.","Hi ! However effective the contraceptive device may be and however least the chance might be, there is always a possibility that you might get pregnant unknowingly by chance. The pregnancy might have got miscarried partially and there are retained products of conception in the uterus resulting in passage of such clots or bleeding. The problem could also be due to a side effect of the contraceptive device you are using due to the effect of hormones. To know which is true, you have to get reviewed by your gynecologist, who may advise you for a urine pre-test, a serum Chat Doctor and an ultrasound abdomen. If all these things are alright, then possibly it is time to rethink of the alternative ways of contraception without any hormone preparation. Wising you an early recovery."
"Hi , My brother was suffering from panic attacks for 8-9 months. while reducing the course of medicine he feels the same issue is coming back again. He is now prescribed lonazep .25  half tablet in morning and 1/2 in evening along with rexipra 5mg. Dr. asked to leave the tablet when he feel ok. what can be effect once he discontinues the lonazep ? is there any chance he can get addicted to lonazep if same issue back again?","Hi, I do appreciate your concern for your brother. Panic disorder responds well to treatment if provided adequately. Extra (Escitalopram) is a safe and effective treatment option for panic disorder. However, the current dose of 5 mg/day is suboptimal. The dose range for Escitalopram is between 10-20 mg/day. Located is clonazepam which helps in reducing the anxiety on symptomatic basis. The anxiety remains controlled as long as it is taken, but will re-emerge when it is stopped. The problem is, with time, there is a high chance for developing dependence on it. So, it is usually recommended only for a short period of time. In your brothers case, I would recommend that you discuss with his psychiatrist regarding increasing Escitalopram further up (to 20 mg as required). It will help control his panic attacks and he won't need clonazepam. Moreover, the treatment with Escitalopram should be continued even after the panic attacks has stopped completely (around 1-2 years), to prevent relapse. I do hope I was able to answer your query. Best wishes."
I recently had a doctor perform a epidural steroid injection that was supposed to be a left side tranforminal ESI at L-5/S-1. He stuck the needle in my right side of my back/spine. Can a left transforminal ESI be performed via a needle on the right side.,"The vertebral column is a single central column. Imagine it like a circular cylinder. Now there are nerves coming out of the cylinder, so we need to be careful there. The left side nerve travels left and right side nerve travels right. So if I go for left from left side, the chances are that I may actually damage a nerve. On TGE left side. Needle is a straight structure. So When I have to get to the side, I move from the right side. Since the nerve is travelling to the right, the needle will not touch it. I move to the left, and the needle reaches the correct place before getting to the nerve hope that explains to you how it is displease feel free to ask another query. I would be glad to help you. Looking forward to your return query with the details asked so that I can help you further. (If the answer has helped you, please indicate this)"

Your symptoms can be caused not by gallstones, but by heart attack (you did well taking aspirin, but you should also visit a doctor right away).  You should not wait anymore and have it checked with ECG and heart enzymes (CK-MB and Troponin) right away. Such symptoms can also appear due to bile ducts blockage, acute pancreatitis. These two should not be neglected as well and checked as soon as possible. Gallstones are the less important to rule out. You should have abdominal ultrasound, full blood work, liver tests (AST, ALT,GTP), amylase, bilirubin, urinalysis. Hope this will help. Regards."

My wife has gone through all tests like HSG etc. My semen analysis shows 34 million count, 40% motility. My Doctor have recommended for me Ubiphene for 3 months, Fertisure D. Kindly advice me for good result.","Hi, I would suggest consulting infertility specialist and undergo reproductive hormone analysis, USG scan, ovarian follicle study and HSG test for your wife. If it comes normal then nothing to worry. Otherwise, specific treatment will depend on cause. Now coming to your report. You mention the sperm count of 34 million. It is total sperm count then it is slight less, but if it is per ml then it is considered as normal. Total motility should be greater than 40%. So your count and motility is just below normal. You can take iPhone for 3 months, and it will give good result. If problem persist, then undergo USG scan, serum testosterone, semen culture to find any other pathology.

I m slightly overweight , but am healthy otherwise... Thanks","Hi, What you are describing appears to be postural hypotension, in which sudden sitting/getting up from supine position causes low blood pressure and makes you feel dizzy. Valium is not likely to help. Take lots of fluids. Avoid sudden changes in posture and make slow movements so that the body can adjust the blood flow. Some medicines can cause this as a side effect, so ask your doctor to evaluate for you for all possible causes. Hope you find this helpful. Best wishes."

"Hello I recently began body building again and I don t smoke or drink but have tried a pre workout supplement called hemo-rage. Since I have, I have been experiencing loss of erection which is unusual for me as I usually can t stop getting them, I have a very high sex drive. It s very upsetting, as when intimate with my partner I cannot sustain or sometimes achieve an erection. It isn t anxiety , I am very comfortable with her but I think it might be this supplement. After training my penis is smaller too.","Degree understand your concerns went through your details. You started body building training and that is the correct answer to your question. Also, you cannot rule out anxiety. Body needs energy to do its day to day functions. You started body building and the energy is being spent on that front and therefore your body struggles to adjust energy for other activities such as sex or masturbation. Almost every body builder faces this problem. Your supplement has nothing to do with this. Your penis has not become smaller. The training schedule made you anxious about your sexual performance, and now you feel all these. Means all these problems are just in your mind. Forget it. But body building and sex go hand in hand only if you have enough energy. Distribute your energy wisely. Hope this answers your query. Available for further sexology clarifications. Good luck."

What Madican I can give now. and wanted to know what is econorm sashet for?,Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. It seems your kid is having viral diarrhea.

Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.

"On the 14th I gave a urine sample that came back with WBC of 11 and for leukesterase it said large. This was because I was having flank pain, nausea and shaky legs. The doctor said I did not have an infection. Today, on the 19th I gave another sample and the results did not note the WBC count but for leukesterase it said negative. What could account for the difference and why would my WBC be high if I do not have an infection? Thank you.","Hi, WBC presence of 11 is definitely urinary tract infection, unless there is a contamination during collection or in laboratory. Whenever WBC count is high, leukocyte esterase will also increase. For confirmation of Urinary tract infection, culture might be necessary. However, now that you have normal counts, you need not worry. Were you on any antibiotic therapy? If more details are available between 14th and 19th like history and reports, I will be able to help you more. Any further queries, happy to help again."
MY WIFE IS SUFFERING FROM TYPHOID FEVER SINCE LAST 4 WEEKS. DOCTORS ARE GIVING ANTIBIOTICS LIKE MONOCEF 2000 MG TWICE A DAY. NOW THEY ALTERED ANTIBIOTICS SAYING THAT OLD MEDICINES WERE NOT RESPONSIVE. HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO RECOVER FROM HERE? THEY ARE GIVING HEAVY DOSES OF ANTIPYRETICS. WILL THERE BE ANY SERIOUS SIDE EFFECT OF SUCH A HEAVY DOSE OF MEDICINES,"Hi, The treatment of Typhoid fever requires use of intravenous antibiotics like Azithromycin and/or Monomer in high doses, until the Tidal test titles start to Chat Doctor.  In addition, the symptoms of the patient like fever spikes are taken into consideration to determine the duration of antibiotic course. It is not uncommon to change the antibiotic in non-responding patients.  This is due the fact that, most microorganisms have developed resistance to various antibiotics including typhoid causing bacteria particularly in the endemic zones. The duration of treatment depends on variety of factors like bacterial load, sensitivity to antibiotics, patient condition and underlying co-morbidity(if any). Average patient, with no underlying health issues and on appropriate antibiotics recover fully in about 6-8 weeks. The heavy dose of antibiotics is crucial to control the infection and to prevent complications in typhoid patients like intestinal perforations, peritonitis, ulcers in the intestine and neurological complications with spread to brain. Therefore, only after considering risk-benefits the treatment regime is prescribed.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care"

Welcome to Chat Doctor. I read your query. Your problem of reduced mouth opening is due to building up of fibers in oral mucosa due to long term use of tobacco. For this, foremost thing required is immediate quitting of tobacco use. Without doing that, no treatment will work. A to Z is a multivitamin tablet which releases free articles and help in breaking up fibers. It is taken once a day. Along with this take healthy diet, lots of fluid. Do mouth opening and closing exercises 5-6 times daily. If mouth opening reduces critically, then you need to visit an oral surgeon. Hope the answer helps you. Thank you."
My lmp was jan 29th but I had to take medroxyprogesterone to get that period. I have been ttc. Not really sure what exact day I ovulated so I was having sex alot ever since I had my last period. Well Wednesday March 9th I went to the Er and they did a blood pregnancy test that came up negitive. I was sure I wasnt pregnant but I also had very light pink spotting twice that same day and havent had nothing else. I was thinking that it could have been implantation bleeding. My question is even though the blood test was negitve could I still be pregnant? Could I have just gotten pregnant alot later than I thought? Would the ChatDoctor hormore been present if I had implantation bleeding the same day I got the blood test done? I also should mention that the reason I dont know when I ovulated is because I recently had my paraguard IUD taken out in December so I havent been having my period on my own. I took medroxyprogesterone to have a period. But I only took it in jan to try and get back to normal. I havent taken it recently. What do you think ?,"Hi, I think if blood test is negative, then you can't be pregnant.  bChatDoctor will come positive in blood even if you have implantation bleeding.  But I think if you don't get your periods within one week, then you can repeat a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  If negative, you can take some medicines for inducing periods.  If positive consult a doctor.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor."

"Hi my husband has been diagnosed the pancreatic cancer. He has been having chemotherapy for this. We have noticed that his testicles have gone a dark colour. Would this have anything to do with the chemo, or could it have something to do with a blood infection. He actually passed away on Friday 22/8/14.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion he might be having infection and decreased blood supply in testis. Chemotherapy makes patient immunosuppressive and prone to infection. And much chemotherapy Chat Doctor.

"My 20yr old daughter has been diagnosed with right basal pneumonia, she also has asthma, she has almost completed a seven day course of 500mg (3xdaily) of Amoxycillan, she has had a 3 day course of prednisolone (6x5mg) and is now two days into on a second course of (same dosage as before). She is not really feeling any improvement in her symptoms and has been getting chest pain and dizziness in addition to her difficulty breathing since around the third day of her antibiotic course, this happens even at rest. She has had blood tests and chest X-ray at the hospital which diagnosed the pnenmonia and started her on antibiotics. She did not seem to have any crackles, but instead advised she had reduced air intake/breathing sounds on the lower right hand lobe. She has lost her appetite and has lost around 14 pounds in weight over the last two weeks. She gets chest pain (possibly heartburn?) after eating and when taking her antibiotic tablet. How long is it likely to be before she starts to recover? Is her illness contagious?","Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done sputum culture and sensitivity report to guide antibiotic therapy. And no need for prednisolone (steroid). As steroid actually lowers the immunity and flare up the infection. So unless strongly indicated steroids are contraindicated in pneumonia. So your daughter needs identification of causative organism and directed antibiotic therapy. If sputum is not available than bronchoscopy and BAD (Bronchoalveolar Lavage) analysis is needed to isolate organism. Since she is not improving with current treatment, stop steroid and consult pulmonologist for proper diagnosis and treatment."

Went 4weeks, started probiotics and have just re introduced apples. She hs had two middle of the night crying spells (lasting about 20 minutes each) in which cry sounded as though she was in pain, some shorter crying spells during the day, one diaper with mucous, and inreased cough now followed by congestion and steady nasal disharge (seems to be starting a cold today). This evening I noticed her nose is bleeding though it is runny not dried out.

My oncologist, my digestive specialist, and my primary doctor are not gel ppl ing or won t tell me. A urologist said I gained weight and the fat belly made it draw in.","Hi. With clear diagnosis and procedures done and complication post cirrhosis of liver indicate that nothing much can be done as far as modern science is concerned. Moreover, the cirrhotic condition is irreversible. Support of steroids etc. must have been planned by your able doctors. If I were your doctor I would have advised you get the help of traditionally (Ayurveda) used decoction of herbs which controls the progress of cirrhosis. Even cures in initial stages. But since It's too late and also your age factor, you cannot expect miracles in Ayurveda or Allopatry. But one thing is clear that if you take this decoction and some other simple medicines, you will certainly see improvement in signs and symptoms and appetite and other things. Whatever time you live, you will feel better day by day. This is pathway quoth prepared by about 7 herbs but not commonly available. However, raw herbs freely available. Since profit is not much in it, companies do not take interest in marketing it. No need to be apprehensive. This is safe with no bad effects.

Here liver enzymes value are high. These enzymes present in hepatocytes and in bile calculi.... So affection of them can lead release of enzymes in blood and so value high.... So cause has to be searched for....USG abdomen can be done.... It will help in find out fatty liver, gall stone or cholestatsis like condition. If history of eaten outside food then hepatitis A rule out by viral marker study for that by ELISA .... If history of unsafe sex or blood transfusion or operation hepatitis b and c ruled out by ELISA..... If positive cardiac history or muscular problem then also enzymes can elevate. If cause undiagnosed then liver biopsy can be done to rule out cause. With keeping this in mind consult gastroenterologist. Take care.... Chat Doctor."
"Hi doctor, I am 28 year old married female. My periods are regular. we are trying to conceive since 1 year without any luck . So we went to an infertility specialist to ensure that things are normal. Doctor did my husbands semen analysis and the mobility rate is only 20%.I am undergone trans vaginal sonography, and i am normal.But for me doctor prescribed siphene 100 mg for 5 days(day 3rd to day 7 of cycle) and advised for scan on 9th or 10th day. My question is siphene 100mg needed for me,when my scan result came as normal.","Hi there ~I understand your concerns.  Since the semen analysis of your husband shows that the motility rate of your husbands sperm is 20% you might need to go for an IVF or an GUI(though less of a chance than IVF).  I wonder if you have consulted another gynecologist for a second opinion.  I think you should and make sure you do not leave any stone unturned at this time. I hope this helped, and I wish you the very best.  Take care!"

Noted you have chronic Chat Doctor. . So you might have allergic cough.... For that try to identify allergen and allergy test can be done.... If you have allergy related cough then repeated congestive symptoms might occur . Repeated viral infection also can be the cause... Get your nose examined for polyp... If no allergy found by history and examination then smoking history ruled out. Smoking can lead cough by irritation... If you have acid reflux disease associated with heart burn then omeprazole given with supportive are as it can lead cough ... Consult pulmonologist and get your resp examination done. If needed spirometry and chest x-ray done. It might reveal bronchitis or COPD like cause...and accordingly treated. Take care.
"Hi ....I was diagnosed for MVP with very mild MR in 2005 (I went to see the doctor after experiencing a sharp pain in the right side of my chest) Since then I am in regular follow-up (annually). My doctor (Cardiologist) informed me it is a normal condition and 10 in 100 people will have this. I had few problem at the initial time of diagnosis such as palpitation, etc. My doctor suggested me to take atenol 25 mg quarter tablet each day along with ecosprin 75 mg. He informed me that in case if i experience any pain or discomfort, he asked me to visit him. Later, in 2010 I went to re-check again, I was advised to take ECG, Echocardiogram and xray. The report said all my test results are normal and no sign of MVP or MR. My doctor informed me I got well and no need to take medicines. Now in Dec 2011, for more than a week I again experience discomfort in the right side of my chest. I went to my doctor he checked my pulse and BP and referred me for ECG. He also asked me to start taking Aten 25...but this time 1/2 tablet each day. I am confused about what s happening to me. My age is 32, Height: 5.72 cms: Weight: 72kg","Hi, Firstly, MVP that you may be having is very common as your cardiologist told you and need not worry if it's associated with mild MR. if you're having palpitations or mild pricking chest pain, then B blocker (atenolol) in low dose may help you without any side effects. Moreover, the medicine you're on is in very low dose and if you can bear the symptoms then you may altogether stop them. Keep a regular check up with cardiologist yearly."
"My uncle is 92 years old, never been sick, and has all of his faculties.  Recently he has been having """"episodes"""" where he becomes light headed and has even passed out for a time.  Doctors are monitoring his heart medication and thinking about a pacemaker.  Is he too old to consider this?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I can certainly understand your concern. I have worked through your query in detail. Pacemaker can be considered in your grandfathers case. His age is not an absolute contraindication for a pacemaker. Infact a pacemaker implantation performed by an experienced operator is a safe procedure for patients of advanced age. The patients who are above 70 years old may have less complication rates than the younger patients according to various scientific articles in various studies.Hence, you can go ahead with your doctors opinion and advise. Complete cardiac evaluation is required before implantation of a cardiac pacemaker.It's advisable to take an expert opinion from an interventional cardiologist before going for the procedure. Please check with your physician if he shares my view and if you can prescribe these medications to you. Post your further queries if any. Thank you"
Hi  name is Derek i am 50yrs old and have been taking dihydrocodiene for approx 12yrs up to 600mg per day my questiston is what is the  best way to come off them.i am 5ft 10 inches in height and weigh  just under 8 stone. your help in this matter would be most appreciated.,"This is going to need close supervision. At 100-150 mg/day. A program with Suboxone, meetings, family involvement will work the vast majority of the time. And at much higher doses it is hard to get onto the Suboxone because it would precipitate with Chat Doctor. Gradual lowering of dose with other medications to handle side effects as they arise. There can be individual issues that I couldn't be aware of that would even further complicate the situation. I cannot say in your particular case, but his is some general information."
"I have three kids with allerhic rhinitis and when the attack occurs all of them get sick at the same time with fever, colds and coughs..I have already research about thier sickness but my concern is when I bring them to thier pediatrician she immediately gave an antibiotic and disudrin but I have read that antibiotic will only thicken the mucus and causes my kids to have difficulty in breathing...should I stop the antibiotic?",Antibiotics have no role in thickening or thinning mucus. It just kills / suppress bacteria causing infection. If your pediatrician feel that there is bacterial infection then your kids will need antibiotics. You can give them without worrying about mucus consistency. Apart from that if they are suffering from allergic rhinitis use anti-allergic spray for acute symptoms and maintenance if very frequent episodes. Best wishes

"i have been having these weird spells. my heart beats fast regulary. bout 90 a min, sometimes faster and them i get real hot sick to my stomack and feel like im going to pass out. my doc here said anxeity. my lips also stay numb. i dont believe its anxeity.","Hello, Your recent clinical symptomatology is highly suspicious of a potential cardiac arrhythmia. Irregular fast heart beating and near fainting support such a conclusion. Coming to this point, it is necessary discussing with your cardiologist on the possibility of performing a careful physical exam and additional medical tests as follows:- Resting ECG-Complete Blood Count-Thyroid hormones level-Blood electrolytes level-Fasting blood glucose-Cardiac ultrasound, liver and renal function tests In case an intermittent cardiac arrhythmia is suspected, an ambulatory ECG (Holder) monitoring is advisable.

"Hi, For a while now I keep getting a red blotchy rash all over my chest. It only seems to occur when I eat hot food, I get nervous in a situation like interview for instance or if I drink alcohol but sometimes if I just change environment it can occur. It flares up for about 20 minutes then goes away. Are there any treatments I can take for this as it is really affecting me now. Thank youAlice","All the triggers that you mentioned are situations where the body interprets as a condition of stress(hot food, Anxiety, Alcohol, Environment). The exact mechanism for a stress related rash or urticaria is still unknown. However, antihistamines do help along with treatments that would lower your bodies response to stress. These include relaxation techniques(You can try yoga and deep breathing) and incorporating exercise in your daily life as it would modulate your response to stress. Thank you for your query."
"My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer 8 years ago, which spread to the brain 3 years ago. Recently we were told the lesions in the brain have continued to grow and at this point there is nothing else they can do as she has received focal radiation 2x and full brain radiation. She has other areas that are affected like her adrynoel gland but we are told that without treatment for the brain the chemo for the lung area isn t really going to help as the brian growth will be the ultimate issue. Her doctors have stopped treatments and have given us a 3 - 6 month prognosis . However, her oncologist has also indicated that her cancer is a slow growht cancer. She was given an MRI in April where they indicated there was minor fluctuation. Had another MRI on 6/6 slight increas from 1.9 x 1.8 to 2.2 x 2.1. Another lesion increased from 1.0 x 0.9 to 1.4 x 1.0 and a third increased from 1.3 x 0.7 to 1.5 x 0.9. She had her final MRI on 7/24 and the three increased to 2.9 x 2.4 from 2.2 x 2.1 and 1.8 x 1.1 from 1.5 x 0.9. From what i have read once a patient stops chemo it seems like the general prognosis is 3 - 6 months? Do you think the prognosis is accurate? It doesn t appear that the lesions grew signficantly.","As the appearance of the sessions tells us she has slow growing tumor. The brain sessions can be treated now with new radiotherapy techniques such as MRT, SRS after seeing the MR even though she has received radiation previously.about chemo, if general condition is fair she can continue chemo -It is not like that chemo stopped the prognosis is 0nly months. The brain lesson will grow continuously until she receives the radiation therapy"

Any chest physiotherapy is being done to him ? Does the baby achieved his milestones of development ? Any family history of allergies or asthma ? If you answer yes for the 1st 3 questions and no to last 2, then your children respiratory problems is less likely to be caused by allergy even if its there, the common cause is weakness of his respiratory muscles, so he can't have his sputum out, and this predisposes him to infections chest physiotherapy is very helpful along with some nebulizer meds that his pediatrician can prescribe I hope this helps"

"Hello Dr. Christensen, I am anemic and have very low iron in my blood. The doctor put me on a slow release iron supplement which I have been taking for the past three days. I ve had terrible stomach pain in the top portion of my stomach underneith the top of my liver , it s just below the right rib cage near the center of my chest , it s dull and ache and it hurts when I go to sleep and wakes me up at night. I felt neauseus a few times but never throw up. I know that I do not tolerate iron well and the pain I m having is just like when I take an antibiotic . I m allergic to pennicillin so I take non pennicillin antiobiotics when I need to but haven t been on them in months. I also have a lot of burping. I m planning on seeing my doctor but wasn t sure if it would just pass?","Hi, Thank you for posting your question here, I will try to answer it as best I can. Iron supplements can cause diarrhea/constipation, abdominal discomfort and other gastrointestinal side effects, as such it is quite obvious that what you're feeling is because of the supplements. Since you need the iron for your blood it can't be avoided, what you can do is talk to your doctor and ask if you increased your iron intake by eating more red meat/green vegetables is it enough so that you can avoid taking the pills. He might say no, if your iron levels are extremely low. I hope this answered your question."

The chances of sepsis following prostatic biopsy is low- 0.1% to 0.3%.

In addition, whether the bacteria are still present on blood culture or are the cultures now clear of bacteria. His prognosis and course of recovery expected. I hope this helps"

Hi I ve been on nuvaring for a month and a half now after ring free week I put the ring back in on Friday like I was supposed to however I was having vaginal burning and itching which I later found out was a yeast infection. Not knowing what the symptoms were I took out the ring on Saturday and put it back in on Sunday 5 days later I had unprotected sex is there a possibility that I could get pregnant. I know when you first start the ring you have to wait 7 days however I had the ring in for a month and used it exactly as directed so I figured I was still protected even though I took it out that one day. & now its been 5 days since the unprotected sex and i m having cramping and breast tenderness. This happened last month when my original period was supposed to come before I started nuvaring. Is this normal or could I be pregnant its to early to take test,"Hi there, Th effectiveness of Nova ring is hampered if removed from vagina for more than three hours. Since you had removed it for a day, in the first week of the cycle it is possible that the hormonal suppression that needs to occur due to Nova ring might have been affected and caused to have ovulation to occur in this cycle. So yes its possible that you could be pregnant. You should test for pregnancy, 28 days after your previous period. As if pregnancy has occurred it is likely to show by then. Have you taken adequate treatment for the yeast infection? Hope this helps. Regards."
"I have been experiencing right side lower back pain. This has been going for a while. Lately it has been severe. I am unable to walk,sit or lay down other than briefly. Pain pills of script strength have no effect muscle relaxers also have no effect. The pain will move from the right side to the middle lower back. Wearing pants with belt or elastic waist makes it worst. Ibuprophen is the only thing that relieves the pain temporarily.","Hello!  I read your concerns.  Low back pain is commonly caused by muscle spasms which could be due to posture, heavy activity, or trauma.  However, since muscle relaxants don't work on you, it could be something else-- slipped disc, osteoarthritis, scoliosis, kidney stones, and other causes.

Is it bad, and what do info to get rid of it? Help! Im very scared",Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I read your query. The hole in your gums is actually sinus or in plain words pus in gums due to infection. Check if you have cavity in corresponding teeth. Do not move or pinch the access as it can further lead to infection. I suggest you visit dentist and get an x-ray done of that area. It may require RCT of infected tooth or teeth or curettage if it is gum infection. Both are minor procedures done under Local anesthesia. RCT may require multiple visits. Do warm saline rinses. This will help Chat Doctor.  Get antibiotic and painkiller prescription from dentist. Maintain oral hygiene and healthy diet. Hope the answer helps you. Thank you!
"I was suffering from impetigo due to a bacterial infection on my face and it spread to many areas of my face which caused the skin to peel off and become raw. After taking oral antibiotics and applying triamcinolone acetonide 0.025% ointment on my face, the skin healed. However, they healed brown. Why did it heal brown and how can I make them fade away quickly?","HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor, Impetigo is a skin infection caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus Diogenes, and it causes fluid-filled spots or blisters. Usually it will be a small fluid-filled spots that are about 1 to 2 cm in diameter and rarely be able to see these because they will quickly burst and then crust over and turn yellow and honey colored. The spots will eventually Chat Doctor. You will normally need antibiotics either as a cream or orally to treat the infection and to prevent you infecting others. Antibiotic cream called juridic acid are effective in clearing up most impetigo infections within seven days, and you will need to use it two to three times a day. If the infection doesn't clear and widespread you may require oral antibiotics like flucloxacillin and azithromycin. Thank you."

Please help, i don t know what else to do, his been having this kind of cough since nearly 2 months now",HiT hanks for your querulous history seems to me that your children asthma symptoms are not controlled well with forecourt only though you didn't mention the dose. If its 100 then it is to be stepped up to 200. Montelukast is to be added to the prevailing therapy. Buy a peak flow meter and maintain a peak-flow chart regularly. All these are to be done under guidance of a pulmonologist. During exacerbation what are doing for nebulization is absolutely normal. But you should consult pulmonologist for better asthma control and discuss the issues which I have mentioned here. You will be benefitted. Thank you.

had a tooth pulled last monday and it was complicated. So I knew the pain was going to last longer. But it has gotten worse. Do believe it might be a dry socket. I am in extreme pain and even more so when air hits it. Is there a temporary solution til I get back to the dentist??,"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The pain can be because of the inflammatory response secondary to the trauma to the lymphatics. It can also be because of the Chat Doctor. The sensitivity particularly when air enters that area is because of the exposed dentin of the next tooth to the extraction site. Nothing to be panic. Continue the same medicines. You can take painkillers like diclofenac 50 mg BID with a serratiopeptidase tablets. For the sensitivity, you can use desensitizers like strontium chloride. Apply over the teeth and leave it for a minute and brush your teeth with normal brush. Do it twice daily, for a week. I hope my answer will help you, take care."
im 45 years old and about 5 or6 years ago i started having what my dr called panic atacs she put me on larizapan and they slowly went away i have not had one for about 2 years. but just the last month or so i started getting them agan and werse the befor it scares the heck out of me becouse i have high blood presher.and not sure if it s that or not,"HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor I can understand your situation. I appreciate your effort to seek online support. For panic attacks, SSRIs are the mainstay of treatment like paroxetine, sertraline etc. However, alprazolam, lorazepam and clonazepam are also helpful. Since you have high blood pressure (possibly related to these attacks), you must visit a general physician first to rule out any medical illness. After that, visit a psychiatrist for detailed evaluation and management. Hope it helps Good luckRegards"
"I injected 3 ml. Of testosterone enanthate and 1.5 mil. Of deca un my right butt cheek. A day later it is hard and painful to walk or sit on. Not red or hot, but very painful. A large hard lump has developed. Will it absorb into my body ? How long might it hurt. Do I ice it or apply heat?",Hi. Can understand your concern. As per your complaint a painful lump at the site of injection can occur due to inflammatory reaction due to irritation caused by the injection medicine leading to formation of a hard lump as a result of inflammatory process. It can also be due to infection caused at the site of injection and the bodies defense mechanism tries to wall off or confine the infection and there is formation of a small abscess which can appear as a hard painful lump. In case if it has occurred due to inflammation it will gradually resolve itself. You can apply a steroid based ointment over it for reducing inflammation and pain. You can take over the counter painkiller like Advil or Motrin which will reduce inflammation and provide pain relief. Cold compresses can also be helpful. In case of abscess formation antibiotic therapy and painkillers can provide relief. I would suggest you to consult a physician and get evaluated to rule out the exact cause of the lump formation and get treated accordingly. Hope your query is solved.

As you had a past history of Cervical disc surgery and now stenosis of the spine is making a lot of trouble in the back, I will advise to take up an MRI scan. As I feel there might be some compromise of the spinal nerves and discs. Also, for spinal stenosis, at your age undergoing conservative management Should be of choice. As you are already under medication why don't you try doing physical therapy as the combination of both has provided good results in my clinical practice. Also, nerve blocker will be of good choice to undergo but getting the muscle strength is also of due importance. Regards Jay In Chat Doctor."

Cancer is a difficult condition to treat and depends on the individual case. Your husband had a surgery followed by chemotherapy that has been on for last 6 months. It is possible that due to side effects of chemotherapy he is unable to have a good meal because of lack of appetite. Along with inability to eat there is also decreased liquid and water intake in many people on treatment with chemotherapy. In this situation you must see that he has an adequate fluid intake of 2.5 liters every day to keep his HY Chat Doctor.

It seems that you are suffering from Allergic Rhinitis, an allergic condition. You should identify the allergen and avoid it. Taking antiallergic medicines like Fenofexadine 120 mg once a day, will be helpful. Take medicines under medical supervision only. Also get your blood tested for Complete Blood Count including Absolute Eosinophil Count. Make it a habit of washing your hands with soap and water before and after meals. This will decrease the frequency and duration of infection. Also eat fresh fruits and vegetables. This increases your immunity to fight infections.  If the problem persists, get yourself examined by a Physician. I hope this is helpful to you. Thanks."

Hi I am Clint 40 yrs old I use to have panic attacks around 8 years ago until i went to a a doctor. he prescribed me pexep tabs which i started from 20 mg and went up to 40 mg. the medicines were of great and i felt good. but recently i went back to him and asked him to give me something cheaper as pexep 30 mg really got expensive and with age i found that less effect. now he has prescribed me mirtax 7.5 with maxgalan tbs before dinner ever since i started it i am feeling totally druged and and down unable to cosentrate on anything escpecially in the morning. Can you tell me the reason for feeling this ways or what should be done????? Regards Cllint,Hello...... Thanks for your query. The symptom of excessive sleepiness can be attributed to T. Mirtax which is a sedative anti-depressant/anxiolytic and inability to concentrate might be due to anxiety symptoms which have increased following shift in medication. I would suggest you to consult your psychiatrist again and report of the above symptoms since you require a cheaper alternative to T. Paroxetine which at the same is equally effective and free of side effects. Wish you early recovery. Regards Chat Doctor.
Should i be worried because i want to have children and my husband and I have been trying {I was on the depo for about a year} when should i expect my body to return to normal {i have been getting a seven day period for the last two months}. My cervical mucus is not clear like egg whites (its like a mixture of clear and white). What should i do?,"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. It can take a while for the effects of Demo to wear off enough for a woman to ovulate again. However, in your case, the fact that you have had two normal cycles is reassuring that your hormones are working normally. 80 percent of couples conceive within 1 year of trying, so it is not necessary to have any evaluation for fertility problems unless you have been trying for at least a year. The best time to try to get pregnant is between when your period finishes and the time you begin to feel PMS symptoms. Once you get PMS symptoms, it means you are already pregnant or your ovulation had passed. Intercourse every other day maximizes the sperm count per ejaculate. I hope I adequately answered your question today and that this information was reassuring. Best wishes,"

Usually, it will take 48-72 hours for fever to come down after starting antibiotic. If he is not very tired and taking diet as usual, need not worry-just wait for 2-3 days. Meanwhile, give him plenty of oral fluids (ORS best) and a soft diet. The diarrhea is probably related to antibiotic. It is because of alteration in our normal gut flora-will subside once the treatment is completed. If diarrhea is quite disturbing, we may need replacement of antibiotic and addition of a probiotic, your doctor will guide you. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further."

"Hi, I have been trying to conceive around 6 years now and no luck. I have a child that is 8 and had no problem getting pregnant with her. I had an IUD after having her and had it taken out after about a year bc it was causing me to keep getting bv. Since having it removed I ve had irregular periods and I don t ovulate. I had laparoscopic surgery and my OBGYN said that everything looks great and that I m extremely fertile but my ovaries aren t releasing my eggs. She had put me on a few rounds of Clomid prior to the surgery but I didn t ovulate it just caused hyperstimulation of my ovaries so she said I couldn t take it anymore. I guess my question is what can I do? What is the best next step for me to take? Please help, I m so aggravated with all of this. Thank u","Hallow Dear, Your case seems to be simple and straight forward, though challenging to deal with. You have got problem in releasing eggs (ovulation). So the treatment for you is to induce ovulation. Unfortunately, your ovaries have not responded to Camphene citrate (Closed) which is a primary line of treatment. Now the other option for you is to go for HMG + Chat Doctor combination. HMG causes the maturation of the follicles in the ovaries. When a follicle attains the desired size of about 18 mm and the blood hormonal values satisfy the criteria, Chat Doctor is given to cause the ovulation from the matured ovum. Accordingly, you can adjust the sexual intercourse on or around the day of egg release. I hope this helps you."
"Hi. doctor , I have a stone in my kidney about 12 mm size and i showed to one urologist he said he will check through laser and destroy it. I AM afraid i told him to give medications instead of surgery . He gave me medicines like MagAsorb(2 tablets twice daily) with No-URIC(1 tablets 2 times daily). My advice is that do it really help with this medications. I have heard of systone(himalaya) do this will help easily with enough water to pass by. Pleasem, advice.... THANKYOU very Much","Hi, many thanks for the query! In our body, each kidney is connected to urinary bladder BYA separate narrow tube called """"ureter"""". A stone in kidney has to pass through this narrow ureter to reach bladder & from there through another narrow tube called """"urethra"""", it comes out. Your stone size is 12 mm, but diameter of ureter is smaller enough not to allow this stone pass out. So, some day it will be stuck in the ureter, this will block the urine outflow & urine will start accumulating in ureter just behind the stone (obstruction) & further will accumulate in kidney causing back pressure changes in the form of HY Chat Doctor."

Dizziness, light headdress and blurring of the vision is occurring due to the pressure effects of the tumor. The tumor is compressing the optic nerves thus the blurring of vision.

Finally got in to see rheumatologist, after 20 viles of blood work she has diagnosed me with having spondylopathy & put me on methotrexate , do you think the knee injections are responsible or mere coincidence?",Dear patient Why was the injection of corticosteroids given to your knee? Was it for osteoarthritis or nonspecific pain? If corticosteroids injection is given intra-articular it gives pain for initial 2 to 3 days due to inflammation and subsequently pain decreases. If pain continues after 3 days there are two reasons 1. Corticosteroids were not effective 2. There is little possibility of infection. I would like to advise local ultrasound to rule out collection. If its normal infection is less likely. Methotrexate is given for systemic inflammatory arthritis with Good recovery. Intra-articular corticosteroids injection will not lead to systemic inflammatory arthritis.

I want it to be successful. There will be no reviving me that way. Its fast and easy, and will work the best for sure. Is this what Prozac makes people feel like when they take this medication. I stopped taking it and I am walking in my drs. office mon. morning. Im scared and never felt like doing something so drastic in my life. PLEASE GIVE ME ADVICE !!!","Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your query. I understand that you have been diagnosed to have depression are going through a difficult time due to your suicidal ideas. Now, there have been previous reports of Prozac (Fluoxetine) being associated with an increase in suicidal ideation in child Chat Doctor.  This is not conclusively proven. Moreover, it has not been found to cause any such effects in adults. So, in my opinion, it is more likely that these suicidal thoughts you are having are due to depression rather than due to the medication. I would advise you to review with your doctor for a detailed evaluation and further help. Wish you all the best."
"Hello,I have been sick the past week with weaknesss, cough, fever and a little stomach thing.  I have been taking Advil and Robitusin and sleeping quite a bit.  I have not had much of an appetite but have been eating soup and yogury (something I was craving).   My question is regarding my weight.  It is up quite a bit today and I have not done anything different in regards to my diet.  Can you tell me how much of this can be associated with water retention? Thank you.","Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern. As per your query you have symptoms of fever and cough which is not improving is due to persistence of respiratory tract infection which is getting chronic and leading to such symptoms. I would suggest you to consult ENT specialist without any delay. Doctor may order blood test, throat swab test or virus culture test. You should get an x-ray of the chest done. You should go for pulmonary function tests as well to find out exact extent of infection. Doctor may prescribe antibiotics along with decongestants and bucolic agents. I would suggest to:- You should take decongestant nasal sprays containing Murine for instant relief. - You should avoid hot, sharp and spicy foods. - You should take expectorants. Steam inhalation is very effective for you. - You should use throat lozenges and go rinses with warm saline water. Hope your concern has been resolved. Get Well Soon. Best Wishes,"
I dont know what to do have hit a brick wall with my doctor..for over 6 months I have noticed a dramatic loss of hair. I have been to doctors twice to be told it first was a sinus infection so he prescribed antibiotics and a nasal spray months later went to see hoim again with problem this time he said was due to a fungal infection once agin precribed antibiotics and fungal creamsand ketaconozole shampoo.he said if that doesnt work I have to pay out to see a dematologist..i cant afford to do that and have lost all self confidence with my appearence.,"Thank you for your question!First I would say that loosing up to 100 hair a day is normal, which in your case may be more. I would ask how much hair are you loosing and whether your parents had a hair loss, is your scalp irritated? Have you experienced a severe trauma or emotional stress? If the situation is not clear I will ask you have a blood test done and thyroid hormones to figure out what is the cause. When a patient similar to your conditions comes to my clinic, after suggesting the examinations I mentioned you above, I would strongly recommend he/she starts washing the hair 2 times a week with PHYTOCYIANE shampoo, PHYSICIAN file 1 ampule 3 times a week for a month, then maintenance 1 ampule per week for two months, PHYTOPHANERE capsules, one capsule a day. After this a patient can also have PRP injections or monotherapy with biotin injections which can be done by a specialist. Hope this helps! Please feel free to ask me again."
"hello DoctorMy Father Have 4th Stage Cancer in Liver Lung and Lymph nodeLocal Doctor give Chemotherapy treatment with medicine """"carboplatin"""" and """"paclitaxel""""is this the right drugs and how much my father live after 3 chemotherapy cycle he is very weak.",As your father is suffering from stage 4 cancer and if it is lung cancer that has spread to liver and lymph nodes then carbonation and paclitaxel should work to keep the disease in control. If cancer is of unknown origin that has spread to liver and other sites then also paclitaxel and carbonation should work. As his 3rd cycle is over I would suggest u do CT scan of chest and upper abdomen to see the tumor response to chemotherapy. In average your father can live from 6 months to 1 year if it is already stage 4.
"Hello, My fiancee and I are looking to start a family after we get married. Unfortunately, I found out he has an ED after the relationship started. I have history of uterine fibroids and I had a myomectomy surgery 2 years ago. I understand that the fibroids may grow back again, and I had like to start a family before they do. I discussed this with my fiancee 2 years ago and he was supportive of me. Now, when I am ready to have a baby I find he has ED. We have not been able to have successful intercourse in the past year. I took him to his doctor but she does not think there is a physiological problem. So she ordered him to see a therapist which is frustrating. I ask him to see an urologist and he gave him a prescription for viagra . My fiancee does not tell his doctors everything. He dances around the sex subject and the doctors think its only in his head. I insisted he had tests done, the doctor orders testesterone test and she said it was within normal ranges. I do not know what else to do. Both his family doctor and urologist are not very supportive and are refusing to order any more tests. I do not know what else to do or how to talk to him about this. The ED problem is making it impossible for us to have intercourse and I am starting to consider perhaps artificial insemination . Please advise how I can talk to his doctors to get him the help he needs. Thank you, AAAAA",Hi.AAAA...have your fiancée taken Viagra...for how long...was the intercourse successful after taking that Viagra...please consult another doctor....to whom you both are new....go to urologist and gynecologist ....u can take consultation from psychologist also after pro and gone rules out any organic problem.and...any doctor checked your hubbies nocturnal penile tumescence...what are the tests done for your fiancée...?

"hello sir              my father is a crf stage 5 patients and he is on dialysis last one year, so i want to know is dialysis will be stopped once started and he is also heart patient and can he drink cranberry juice and wheatgrass juice and kidney function will improve after drink cranberry juice and wheatgrass juice","HiT hanks for the query. With the information you have provided, It is difficult to provide a definite answer to your first question, i.e. whether your father can come off dialysis. This really depends on how his kidneys are functioning. This can be determined by finding out his urine output in a day and also specialized tests like 44 hour creatinine clearance test. His pre-dialysis lab results will also help. The second part of the query: there is no evidence to prove that Chat Doctor.  In fact"
Is herpes commonly misdiagnosed? I was examined for a collection of 3 red bumps outside of my vaginal opening ...after a 5 second look at it the Dr said it was herpes and proceeded to prescribe me meds... my culture results have not yet come in...what are other possibilities and what advice do u have on herbal cures?,"Hi, Thanks for posting in Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Genital herpes is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Most cases of genital herpes are caused by infection by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). You may wait for the culture results to add any other medication, if necessary. You need to take the prescribed medications by your doctor. However, here is no cure for genital herpes. But the symptoms can be lessened and prevented with treatment. Treatment can also reduce the risk of infecting others. Treatment recommended would be with antiviral medications, which will help to prevent or reduce the pain and discomfort from an outbreak of symptoms. Medication taken on a daily basis to suppress the virus can reduce the number of outbreaks and reduce the risk of infecting others. You may try home remedies by using Aloe Vera Gel, Bathing with Epsom salt water, Natural oils and ice pack to soothe the skin and reduce the pain associated with it. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best."

"Hi! I m 21 years old and I have been using Depo Trust since December 2011. I wanna switch to Althea, another contraceptive but a pill . My Depo Trust was administered last May 9th of this year and its effectivity will end on August. I wanna switch to Althea. When will be the best time to start switching or taking that pill? Is it okay if I switch to a pill??","Hi dear, and thanks for your query. Most of the time, women should begin taking the pill on the due date of their next scheduled Depo-Provera injection.

If you are going to take the birth control pill after the next scheduled injection date, you should talk to her doctor about backup methods of birth control or avoid sexual intercourse during that time. ALL THE BEST"
